# Rhodiola (Rhodiola rosea)

## Basic Information
- **Latin Name**: Rhodiola rosea
- **Common Names**: Golden Root, Arctic Root, Rose Root, Roseroot, King's Crown, Aaron's Rod, Hong Jing Tian (Chinese), Rosenwurz (German)
- **Plant Family**: Crassulaceae (Stonecrop family)
- **Native Range**: Arctic and mountainous regions of Europe, Asia, and North America
- **Habitat**: Rocky cliffs, alpine meadows, and tundra; thrives in cold, harsh environments at elevations from sea level to 9,000 feet

## Plant Description

### Overall Appearance
Low-growing succulent perennial with thick, fleshy leaves and small yellow flowers; forms dense rosettes and spreads via underground rhizomes.

### Roots
Thick, fleshy rhizome that smells like roses when cut; roots are golden-brown externally, yellowish-white internally, and can live for many decades.

### Stem
Short, thick stems 4-16 inches tall that emerge from the rhizome; stems are reddish and support rosettes of fleshy leaves.

### Leaves
Alternate, fleshy, blue-green leaves 1-3 inches long with serrated margins toward the tip; leaves are thick and waxy to conserve moisture in harsh conditions.

### Flowers
Small, four-petaled yellow flowers (occasionally red) in dense, flat-topped clusters; flowers are dioecious (male and female on separate plants) and bloom in summer.

### Fruits/Seeds
Small, red follicles containing numerous tiny seeds; fruits develop from female flowers and ripen in late summer to fall.

## Medicinal Properties

### Parts Used
- Rhizomes and roots (primary medicinal part)
- Occasionally aerial parts in traditional preparations

### Active Compounds
- Phenylpropanoids (salidroside, tyrosol)
- Phenylethanol derivatives (rosavin, rosarin, rosin)
- Flavonoids (catechins, proanthocyanidins)
- Monoterpenes and triterpenes
- Organic acids (gallic, caffeic acids)
- Essential oils

### Traditional Uses
- Physical and mental fatigue reduction
- High altitude adaptation and oxygen utilization
- Depression and anxiety relief
- Sexual dysfunction and fertility enhancement
- Immune system strengthening
- Longevity and anti-aging
- Memory and cognitive enhancement

### Modern Applications
- Adaptogenic stress response support
- Depression and anxiety management
- Athletic performance and endurance enhancement
- Cognitive function and mental clarity
- Fatigue syndrome treatment
- Altitude sickness prevention
- Immune system modulation

## Preparation Methods

### Traditional Preparations
- **Decoction**: 5-10 grams dried root per cup water, simmer 10-15 minutes
- **Tea/Infusion**: 1-2 teaspoons powdered root per cup hot water, steep 10 minutes
- **Tincture**: 1:5 ratio in 40% alcohol, 1-2 ml twice daily
- **Standardized Extract**: 200-400mg daily containing 3% rosavins and 1% salidroside
- **Traditional Vodka**: Root fermented in vodka for several weeks (Siberian tradition)

### Dosage Guidelines
- Traditional dosages: 200-600mg standardized extract daily or 2-6 grams dried root
- Duration: Use cyclically; 6-8 weeks on, 1-2 weeks off to prevent tolerance

## Safety Information

### Contraindications
- Bipolar disorder during manic episodes
- Severe hypertension (high doses)
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding (insufficient data)

### Side Effects
- Overstimulation or agitation with high doses
- Insomnia if taken late in the day
- Dizziness or jittery feelings
- Dry mouth or excessive salivation

### Drug Interactions
- Diabetes medications (may affect blood sugar)
- Blood pressure medications (may enhance effects)
- Antidepressants (potential interaction)
- Stimulant medications (may enhance effects)

### Special Precautions
- Pregnancy/nursing: Insufficient safety data; avoid use
- Children: Limited safety data; not recommended
- Start with low doses: Begin with lowest effective dose and increase gradually

## Cultivation & Harvesting

### Growing Conditions
- Soil requirements: Well-drained, rocky, sandy soil; pH 6.0-7.0
- Light requirements: Full sun to partial shade
- Water needs: Moderate moisture; excellent drainage essential
- Climate zones: USDA zones 2-7; requires cold winter dormancy

### Harvesting
- Best time to harvest: Roots after 3-5 years in fall when aerial parts die back
- Sustainable harvesting practices: Wild populations are threatened; cultivation preferred
- Post-harvest processing: Clean roots thoroughly; dry slowly to preserve active compounds

## Conservation Status
- Current conservation status: Threatened in many regions due to over-collection
- Threats to wild populations: Commercial over-harvesting, climate change, habitat destruction
- Sustainable sourcing notes: Wild collection should be avoided; choose cultivated sources

## Cultural & Historical Context
- Traditional cultural significance: Sacred plant in Siberian and Scandinavian cultures
- Historical timeline of use: Used for over 3,000 years in Russia, Scandinavia, and Tibet
- Indigenous knowledge acknowledgment: Traditional knowledge from Arctic peoples and Tibetan medicine

## Modern Research
- Recent scientific studies: Extensive research on adaptogenic and antidepressant effects
- Clinical trial results: Proven effective for stress-related fatigue and mild to moderate depression
- Ongoing research areas: Neuroprotection, cancer treatment support, metabolic disorders
