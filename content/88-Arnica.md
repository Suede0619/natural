## Basic Information
- **Latin Name**: Arnica montana
- **Common Names**: Arnica, Mountain Arnica, Wolf's Bane, Mountain Tobacco, Leopard's Bane
- **Plant Family**: Asteraceae (Sunflower/Daisy family)
- **Native Range**: Mountains of Europe and western North America
- **Habitat**: Mountain meadows, moorlands, and acidic grasslands at high elevations

## Plant Description

### Overall Appearance
Arnica is a perennial herb growing 1-2 feet tall with a basal rosette of leaves and distinctive bright yellow daisy-like flowers.

### Roots
Creeping rhizome system spreads horizontally underground, producing new shoots and forming colonies in suitable habitat.

### Stem
Erect, hairy flower stems arise from basal rosette, typically bearing 1-3 flower heads at the top.

### Leaves
Basal rosette of oval leaves 2-3 inches long with parallel veins. Leaves are light green, hairy, and arranged in opposite pairs.

### Flowers
Bright golden-yellow flower heads are 2-3 inches across with 10-15 ray petals around a central disc of tubular flowers.

### Fruits/Seeds
Small achenes (seeds) are topped with white bristly pappus that aids in wind dispersal.

## Medicinal Properties

### Parts Used
- Flower heads (primary medicinal part)
- Occasionally leaves and roots

### Active Compounds
- Sesquiterpene lactones (helenalin, dihydrohelenalin)
- Flavonoids (quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin)
- Phenolic acids (caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid)
- Essential oils
- Carotenoids
- Polysaccharides

### Traditional Uses
- Bruises, sprains, and trauma injuries
- Muscle soreness and inflammation
- Wound healing and cuts
- Rheumatic conditions
- Chilblains and frostbite
- Insect bites and stings

### Modern Applications
- Topical anti-inflammatory for injuries
- Bruise and swelling reduction
- Post-surgical healing support
- Sports injury treatment
- Homeopathic preparations for trauma
- Cosmetic applications for skin health

## Preparation Methods

### Traditional Preparations
- **Topical tincture**: 1:10 ratio in 50% alcohol for external use only
- **Oil infusion**: Flowers infused in carrier oil for massage
- **Ointment**: Traditional preparation with beeswax and oils
- **Compress**: Diluted tincture applied on cloth to affected area
- **Homeopathic**: Highly diluted preparations for internal use

### Dosage Guidelines

## Cultivation & Harvesting

### Growing Conditions
- Soil: Well-drained, acidic, nutrient-poor soil
- Light: Full sun to partial shade
- Water: Moderate moisture, avoid waterlogging
- Climate zones: USDA zones 3-7, requires cool summers

### Harvesting
- Best time: Peak flowering period for highest active compound content
- Sustainable practices: Harvest flowers only, protect root systems
- Post-harvest: Dry quickly to preserve color and bioactive compounds

## Conservation Status
- Endangered or rare in many European regions
- Overharvesting for commercial use has depleted wild populations
- Protected species in several countries
- Cultivation programs being developed to reduce wild collection

## Cultural & Historical Context
- Used in European folk medicine for centuries
- Traditional remedy for falls and injuries from horseback riding
- Name derives from Greek "arnakis" meaning lamb's skin
- Featured prominently in German and Swiss traditional medicine

## Modern Research
