## Basic Information
- **Latin Name**: Salix alba
- **Common Names**: White Willow, European Willow, Silver Willow, Silber-Weide (German), Saule blanc (French)
- **Plant Family**: Salicaceae (Willow family)
- **Native Range**: Europe, western and central Asia
- **Habitat**: Moist soils along rivers, streams, and wetlands; tolerates flooding and wet conditions at elevations up to 3,000 feet

## Plant Description

### Overall Appearance
Large deciduous tree growing 50-80 feet tall with a broad, rounded crown and distinctive silver-white undersides of leaves that shimmer in the wind.

### Roots
Extensive, shallow root system that spreads widely; roots are fibrous and adapted to wet conditions, often forming surface roots near water sources.

### Stem
Thick, deeply furrowed gray-brown bark on mature trees; younger branches are yellowish to reddish-brown with smooth bark; trunk can reach 3-6 feet in diameter.

### Leaves
Alternate, lance-shaped leaves 2-4 inches long with finely serrated margins; upper surface dark green, lower surface silvery-white with fine silky hairs; leaves turn yellow in autumn.

### Flowers
Small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in catkins that appear before the leaves in early spring; male and female flowers on separate trees (dioecious); catkins are 1-3 inches long.

### Fruits/Seeds
Small capsules containing numerous tiny seeds with white, cottony hairs that aid in wind dispersal; seeds are produced in late spring to early summer.

## Medicinal Properties

### Parts Used
- Inner bark (most medicinally active)
- Young twigs and branches
- Leaves (less potent than bark)

### Active Compounds
- Salicin (pro-drug that converts to salicylic acid)
- Populin and tremulacin (related salicyl alcohol glycosides)
- Flavonoids (catechin, epicatechin)
- Tannins (condensed and hydrolyzable)
- Phenolic acids

### Traditional Uses
- Pain relief for headaches, arthritis, and muscle aches
- Fever reduction during illness
- Anti-inflammatory treatment for joint conditions
- Digestive aid for stomach complaints
- Wound healing and skin conditions

### Modern Applications
- Natural pain relief and anti-inflammatory effects
- Fever reduction (antipyretic properties)
- Treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis
- Cardiovascular health support
- Precursor to modern aspirin development

## Preparation Methods

### Traditional Preparations
- **Tea/Infusion**: 1-2 teaspoons dried bark per cup boiling water, steep 10-15 minutes
- **Decoction**: 1 tablespoon chopped bark per cup water, simmer 20-30 minutes
- **Tincture**: 1:5 ratio in 45% alcohol, 2-4 ml three times daily
- **Poultice**: Fresh inner bark ground and applied to wounds or inflamed areas
- **Oil Infusion**: Bark infused in oil for topical anti-inflammatory use

### Dosage Guidelines
- Traditional dosages: 1-3 grams dried bark daily, divided into 2-3 doses
- Duration: Use for acute conditions up to 7-10 days

## Safety Information

### Contraindications
- Allergy to aspirin or salicylates
- Active peptic ulcer disease
- Severe kidney or liver disease
- Children under 16 with viral infections (Reye's syndrome risk)

### Side Effects
- Gastrointestinal irritation or upset stomach
- Nausea or vomiting with high doses
- Allergic reactions in sensitive individuals
- Potential for salicylate toxicity with excessive use

### Drug Interactions
- Blood-thinning medications (warfarin, heparin)
- Other NSAIDs (increased bleeding risk)
- Methotrexate (increased toxicity)
- Diabetes medications (enhanced hypoglycemic effects)

### Special Precautions
- Pregnancy/nursing: Avoid use, especially in third trimester
- Children: Not recommended for children under 16
- Surgical considerations: Discontinue 2 weeks before surgery due to bleeding risk

## Cultivation & Harvesting

### Growing Conditions
- Soil requirements: Moist, well-drained soil; tolerates clay and periodic flooding
- Light requirements: Full sun to partial shade
- Water needs: High water requirements; thrives near water sources
- Climate zones: USDA zones 2-8

### Harvesting
- Best time to harvest: Spring during active growth when sap is flowing
- Sustainable harvesting practices: Harvest outer bark strips, never ring-bark trees
- Post-harvest processing: Dry bark thoroughly; store in cool, dry conditions

## Conservation Status
- Current conservation status: Stable and widely cultivated
- Threats to wild populations: Habitat loss from wetland development
- Sustainable sourcing notes: Easily propagated and grown; choose sustainably harvested bark

## Cultural & Historical Context
- Traditional cultural significance: Sacred tree in Celtic and Germanic traditions
- Historical timeline of use: Used for over 4,000 years; mentioned in ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Roman texts
- Indigenous knowledge acknowledgment: Traditional knowledge spans multiple cultures and continents

## Modern Research
- Recent scientific studies: Extensive research on salicin's anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties
- Clinical trial results: Proven effective for lower back pain and osteoarthritis
- Ongoing research areas: Cardiovascular benefits, cancer prevention potential, standardization methods

## Related Species
- Similar or related medicinal plants: Salix nigra (Black Willow), Salix purpurea (Purple Willow), Populus species
- Potential substitutes or adulterants: Other Salix species with varying salicin content
