- Flavonoids (amentoflavone, quercetin; antioxidant, anti-inflammatory)
- Tannins (astringent, antimicrobial)
- Inulin (prebiotic fiber)
- Juniperin (bitter principle; digestive stimulant)

### Traditional Uses
- Urinary tract infections and kidney disorders
- Digestive problems and poor appetite
- Arthritis and joint inflammation

- Skin conditions and wounds
- Traditional flavoring for gin

### Modern Applications
- Urinary tract antiseptic and diuretic
- Digestive support and appetite stimulation
- Anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects
- Respiratory tract support
- Traditional aromatherapy applications
- Antioxidant and circulation support

## Preparation Methods

### Traditional Preparations
- **Tea/Infusion**: 1 teaspoon crushed berries per cup; steep 15-20 minutes
- **Decoction**: Berries simmered 10-15 minutes for stronger diuretic effects
- **Tincture**: 1:5 ratio with 60% alcohol; macerate crushed berries 4 weeks
- **Essential oil**: Steam distillation (professional preparation only)
- **Gin**: Traditional alcoholic extraction (historical medicinal use)

### Dosage Guidelines
- Traditional dosages: 2-4 grams dried berries daily; maximum 6 weeks continuous use
- Duration: SHORT TO MEDIUM-TERM USE - not for long-term daily consumption

## Safety Information

### Contraindications
- Pregnancy (uterine stimulant and diuretic effects)
- Kidney disease or kidney inflammation
- Heart conditions with fluid retention
- Children under 12 years

### Side Effects
- Kidney irritation with excessive or prolonged use
- Digestive upset and diarrhea
- Skin irritation with topical essential oil
- Increased urination (intended diuretic effect)

### Drug Interactions
- Diuretic medications (may enhance effects)
- Diabetes medications (may affect blood sugar)
- Blood pressure medications
- Lithium (may affect elimination)

### Special Precautions
- Pregnancy/nursing: AVOID - can stimulate uterine contractions
- Children's safety: Not recommended under 12 years
- Surgical considerations: May affect fluid balance during surgery

## Cultivation & Harvesting

### Growing Conditions
- Soil requirements: Well-drained, sandy or rocky soil; tolerates poor, acidic conditions
- Light requirements: Full sun to partial shade
- Water needs: Very drought tolerant; minimal water requirements
- Climate zones: Hardy in zones 2-7; extremely cold tolerant

### Harvesting
- Best time to harvest: Berries in fall of second year when blue-black and waxy
- Sustainable harvesting practices: Harvest selectively; slow-growing plant needs protection
- Post-harvest processing: Dry berries thoroughly; store in airtight containers

## Conservation Status
- Current conservation status: Generally stable; some local population declines
- Threats to wild populations: Habitat loss; climate change; slow growth rate
- Sustainable sourcing notes: Very slow-growing; support conservation and cultivation

## Cultural & Historical Context
- Traditional cultural significance: Sacred to many northern cultures; purification ceremonies
- Historical timeline of use: Millennia of use across northern cultures; gin flavoring since Middle Ages
- Indigenous knowledge acknowledgment: Traditional knowledge from multiple northern indigenous peoples

## Modern Research
- Recent scientific studies: Antimicrobial and diuretic properties confirmed
- Clinical trial results: Effective urinary antiseptic; limited long-term safety data
- Ongoing research areas: Antimicrobial mechanisms; kidney safety; standardization
