## Plant Description

### Overall Appearance
Evergreen tree reaching 25-40 feet in height with pyramidal crown and dense, aromatic foliage producing flower buds used as spice.

### Roots
Deep taproot system with extensive lateral roots; symbiotic mycorrhizal relationships enhance nutrient uptake in tropical soils.

### Stem

### Leaves
Opposite, elliptical leaves 3-5 inches long; leathery texture with prominent oil glands; dark green and glossy with entire margins.

### Flowers
Flower buds harvested before opening; buds pink becoming deep red; nail-shaped with four petals forming cap over stamens.

### Fruits/Seeds
Purple-red berries called "mother cloves" if flowers allowed to mature; contain 1-2 seeds; rarely used commercially.

## Medicinal Properties

### Parts Used
- Flower buds (primary medicinal and culinary use)
- Essential oil from buds
- Leaves (for essential oil)
- Stems (lower grade spice)

### Active Compounds
- Eugenol (70-85% of essential oil; analgesic, antiseptic)
- Eugenyl acetate (anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial)
- Beta-caryophyllene (anti-inflammatory, analgesic)
- Vanillin (antioxidant, flavoring)
- Crategolic acid (antimicrobial)
- Gallic acid (antioxidant, astringent)

### Traditional Uses
- Dental pain and oral health
- Digestive disorders and nausea
- Respiratory infections and bronchitis
- Arthritis and joint pain
- Antiseptic for wounds and infections
- Parasitic infections and worms

### Modern Applications
- Dental anesthesia and oral care
- Antimicrobial and antifungal treatments
- Anti-inflammatory and pain relief
- Antioxidant and liver protection
- Blood sugar regulation
- Cancer prevention research

## Preparation Methods

### Traditional Preparations
- **Tea/Infusion**: 3-5 whole cloves per cup boiling water; steep 10-15 minutes
- **Decoction**: Simmer cloves for stronger extraction; used for parasites
- **Tincture**: 1:5 ratio with 70% alcohol; macerate for 4 weeks
- **Poultice**: Ground cloves mixed with water or oil for topical pain relief
- **Oil Infusion**: Cloves in carrier oil; dilute heavily before topical use

### Dosage Guidelines
- Traditional dosages: 1-3 cloves daily; 1-2 ml diluted essential oil
- Duration: Short-term use recommended for medicinal doses

## Safety Information

### Contraindications
- Bleeding disorders due to blood-thinning effects
- Liver disease patients should limit intake
- Children under 2 years (essential oil)
- Pregnancy in large medicinal doses

### Side Effects
- Skin and mucous membrane irritation
- Allergic reactions in sensitive individuals
- Liver toxicity with excessive essential oil use
- Blood sugar lowering effects

### Drug Interactions
- Blood-thinning medications (warfarin, aspirin)
- Diabetes medications
- Liver-metabolized drugs
- Topical anesthetics

### Special Precautions
- Pregnancy/nursing: Safe in food amounts; avoid large medicinal doses
- Children's safety: Dilute essential oil heavily; avoid in very young children
- Surgical considerations: Discontinue 2 weeks before surgery

## Cultivation & Harvesting

### Growing Conditions
- Soil requirements: Rich, well-drained volcanic soil with organic matter
- Light requirements: Partial shade when young; full sun when mature
- Water needs: High humidity; consistent rainfall; good drainage
- Climate zones: Tropical maritime climates only

### Harvesting
- Best time to harvest: Buds picked when pink but before opening
- Sustainable harvesting practices: Hand-picking preserves tree health
- Post-harvest processing: Sun-dried until brown; requires careful timing

## Conservation Status
- Current conservation status: Not threatened but geographically limited
- Threats to wild populations: Climate change and volcanic activity
- Sustainable sourcing notes: Support small-scale traditional farmers

## Cultural & Historical Context
- Traditional cultural significance: Sacred to Indonesian cultures; ancient trade commodity
- Historical timeline of use: Chinese use 2,000+ years; European spice trade catalyst
- Indigenous knowledge acknowledgment: Moluccan traditional cultivation methods

## Modern Research
- Recent scientific studies: Antimicrobial properties extensively documented
- Clinical trial results: Effective for dental pain management
- Ongoing research areas: Cancer prevention; diabetes management; neuroprotection
