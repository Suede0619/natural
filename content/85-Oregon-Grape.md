# Oregon Grape (Mahonia aquifolium)

## Basic Information
- **Latin Name**: Mahonia aquifolium (syn. Berberis aquifolium)
- **Common Names**: Oregon Grape, Mountain Grape, Holly-leaved Barberry, Mahonia, Blue Barberry
- **Plant Family**: Berberidaceae (Barberry family)
- **Native Range**: Pacific Northwest of North America, from British Columbia to Northern California
- **Habitat**: Coniferous forests, woodland edges, mountainous areas, and open slopes up to 7,000 feet elevation

## Plant Description

### Overall Appearance
Oregon grape is an evergreen shrub that typically grows 3-6 feet tall, forming dense colonies through underground rhizomes.

### Roots
Extensive rhizome system with bright yellow inner bark containing high concentrations of berberine and other alkaloids.

### Stem
Woody stems with smooth gray-brown bark. Inner bark is bright yellow and bitter-tasting.

### Leaves
Compound leaves with 5-9 holly-like leaflets, each with spiny margins. Leaves are leathery, glossy, and dark green, turning bronze-red in winter.

### Flowers
Bright yellow flowers arranged in dense, upright clusters (racemes) appearing in early spring before full leaf development.

### Fruits/Seeds
Dark blue berries with a whitish bloom, resembling small grapes. Berries are edible but quite tart and contain 1-8 seeds.

## Medicinal Properties

### Parts Used
- Root bark and inner bark (primary medicinal use)
- Occasionally berries for food and mild medicine

### Active Compounds
- Isoquinoline alkaloids (2-6% total): berberine, berbamine, oxyacanthine
- Berberine (primary active compound, 0.5-2.5%)
- Tannins (8-12%)
- Resin compounds
- Organic acids

### Traditional Uses
- Skin conditions and eczema
- Digestive inflammation and gastritis
- Infections and antimicrobial applications
- Liver and gallbladder support
- Arthritis and joint inflammation
- Eye infections and conjunctivitis
- Women's health and menstrual irregularities

### Modern Applications
- Clinical treatment for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis
- Digestive disorders (GERD, gastritis, peptic ulcers)
- Antimicrobial infections (bacterial, fungal, parasitic)
- Anti-inflammatory conditions
- Blood sugar regulation support
- Sustainable alternative to goldenseal

## Preparation Methods

### Traditional Preparations
- **Root bark decoction**: 1-2 tsp dried root bark per cup water, simmer 15-20 minutes
- **Tincture**: 1:5 ratio in 50% alcohol, 2-4 ml three times daily
- **Topical preparations**: Oil infusions, salves, and creams for skin conditions
- **Powder**: Ground root bark in capsules, 500-1000mg daily
- **Tea**: Mild preparation for digestive support

### Dosage Guidelines
- Tincture: 2-4 ml (1/2-1 tsp) three times daily
- Decoction: 1/2 cup two to three times daily
- Topical cream: Apply 2-3 times daily to affected skin areas
- Standardized extract: Follow manufacturer's recommendations

## Safety Information

### Contraindications
- Pregnancy and nursing (berberine concerns)
- Severe liver disease
- Hypoglycemia or diabetes medications (monitor blood sugar)
- Children under 2 years old

### Side Effects
- Possible digestive upset with large internal doses
- Yellow staining of skin/clothing from fresh plant
- Rare allergic skin reactions with topical use
- Possible hypoglycemic effects

### Drug Interactions
- May enhance effects of diabetes medications
- Potential interactions with blood-thinning medications
- May interfere with tetracycline antibiotics
- Caution with other berberine-containing herbs

### Special Precautions
- Start with small doses to assess tolerance
- External use generally safer than internal use
- Avoid harvesting from polluted areas
- Sustainable harvesting practices recommended

## Cultivation & Harvesting

### Growing Conditions
- Soil: Well-drained, slightly acidic to neutral soil (pH 5.5-7.0)
- Light: Partial shade to full sun, tolerates deep shade
- Water: Moderate moisture, drought-tolerant once established
- Climate zones: USDA zones 5-9, cold-hardy to -20Â°F

### Harvesting
- Best time: Fall or early spring when alkaloid content is highest
- Sustainable practices: Harvest only older, thicker roots, leave young plants
- Post-harvest: Clean, chop, and dry roots thoroughly for storage
- Storage: Dried root bark maintains potency for 2-3 years

## Conservation Status
- Generally stable in native range but declining in some areas
- Overharvesting concerns due to increased demand as goldenseal alternative
- Cultivation encouraged to reduce wild harvesting pressure
- Important to Native American tribes for traditional medicine

## Cultural & Historical Context
- Sacred medicine to Pacific Northwest tribes for over 2,000 years
- Used by Blackfoot, Chehalis, and other tribes for skin and digestive conditions
- Adopted by European settlers and early American physicians
- Name derives from grape-like clusters of blue berries
- State flower of Oregon

## Modern Research
- Multiple clinical trials documenting efficacy for psoriasis (63% success rate)
- Studies on berberine content and bioavailability
- Research into antimicrobial spectrum and resistance patterns
- Investigation of anti-inflammatory mechanisms
- Sustainability studies comparing to endangered goldenseal

## Related Species
- Mahonia nervosa (Cascade Oregon Grape) - similar properties, smaller growth
- Mahonia repens (Creeping Oregon Grape) - ground-covering variety
- Berberis vulgaris (European Barberry) - related genus with similar alkaloids
- Hydrastis canadensis (Goldenseal) - different family but similar berberine content
