# Bloodroot (Sanguinaria canadensis)

## Basic Information
- **Latin Name**: Sanguinaria canadensis
- **Common Names**: Bloodroot, Red puccoon, Indian paint, Tetterwort, Red root
- **Plant Family**: Papaveraceae (Poppy family)
- **Native Range**: Eastern North America from Canada to Florida
- **Habitat**: Rich, moist deciduous forests; shaded woodland floors; well-drained humus soils

## Plant Description

### Overall Appearance
Perennial herb growing 6-10 inches tall with single lobed leaf and solitary white flower; red-orange rhizome.

### Roots
Thick, horizontal rhizome containing bright red-orange latex; bitter taste; spreads to form colonies.

### Stem
Single flowering stem emerges wrapped in the emerging leaf; no true above-ground stem.

### Leaves
Single, deeply lobed leaf 4-8 inches across; kidney-shaped with 5-9 rounded lobes; blue-green color.

### Flowers
Solitary white flower with 8-12 petals; 2-3 inches across; appears in early spring before leaves fully expand.

### Fruits/Seeds
Elongated capsule containing black seeds with white appendages; ants disperse seeds for food reward.

## Medicinal Properties

### Parts Used
- Rhizome (underground stem - contains active alkaloids)
- Fresh latex (red sap - highly potent)
- Dried root powder (traditional preparations)
- Standardized extracts (modern applications)

### Active Compounds
- Sanguinarine (benzophenanthridine alkaloid; antimicrobial, cytotoxic)
- Chelerythrine (alkaloid; antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory)
- Protopine (alkaloid; smooth muscle effects)
- Allocryptopine (alkaloid; cardiovascular effects)
- Beta-homochelidonine (alkaloid; various physiological effects)
- Berberine (antimicrobial, blood sugar regulation)

### Traditional Uses
- Skin conditions including warts and growths
- Respiratory ailments and bronchitis
- Rheumatism and joint pain
- Digestive disorders and poor appetite
- Topical antimicrobial applications
- Traditional cancer treatments (external use)

### Modern Applications
- Dental care and oral health (very dilute preparations)
- Topical antimicrobial applications (professional use)
- Research into cancer cell cytotoxicity
- Traditional dermatological applications (with extreme caution)
- Historical interest in respiratory support
- Plaque and gingivitis research

## Preparation Methods

### Traditional Preparations
- **CAUTION**: All preparations require extreme care due to toxicity
- **Tincture**: 1:10 ratio with 70% alcohol; professional preparation only
- **Topical applications**: Extremely dilute preparations for skin conditions
- **Dental preparations**: Commercial formulations only (not home preparation)
- **Research extracts**: Standardized alkaloid content for scientific study

### Dosage Guidelines
- Traditional dosages: PROFESSIONAL USE ONLY - toxic in small amounts
- Duration: NEVER for long-term use; acute applications only under guidance

## Safety Information

### Contraindications
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding (highly toxic)
- Children (too dangerous for pediatric use)
- Liver disease (hepatotoxic alkaloids)
- Heart conditions (cardiovascular effects)
- Internal use generally contraindicated

### Side Effects
- Severe skin irritation and burns with direct application
- Nausea, vomiting, and digestive upset
- Cardiovascular toxicity with larger doses
- Liver damage with repeated use
- Respiratory depression in severe poisoning

### Drug Interactions
- All medications (due to general toxicity)
- Liver-metabolized drugs (hepatotoxicity concerns)
- Cardiovascular medications
- CNS depressants

### Special Precautions
- Pregnancy/nursing: ABSOLUTELY AVOID - highly toxic
- Children's safety: NEVER use in children
- Surgical considerations: Avoid entirely if surgery planned

## Cultivation & Harvesting

### Growing Conditions
- Soil requirements: Rich, moist, well-drained woodland soil with high organic matter
- Light requirements: Deep to partial shade; mimics forest floor conditions
- Water needs: Consistent moisture during growing season; summer dormancy
- Climate zones: Hardy in zones 3-8; requires cold winter dormancy

### Harvesting
- Best time to harvest: Fall when plant is dormant (conservation critical)
- Sustainable harvesting practices: RARELY harvest - plant populations declining
- Post-harvest processing: Extreme care handling latex; professional drying only

## Conservation Status
- Current conservation status: Declining in many regions due to habitat loss
- Threats to wild populations: Overharvesting, forest destruction, development
- Sustainable sourcing notes: AVOID wild collection; support habitat conservation

## Cultural & Historical Context
- Traditional cultural significance: Important to many Native American tribes for ceremonial paint
- Historical timeline of use: Centuries of indigenous use; 19th-century medical interest
- Indigenous knowledge acknowledgment: Traditional knowledge from multiple tribal nations

## Modern Research
- Recent scientific studies: Cytotoxic effects on cancer cells documented
- Clinical trial results: Limited due to toxicity concerns; dental applications studied
- Ongoing research areas: Cancer research; antimicrobial mechanisms; alkaloid chemistry

## Related Species
- Celandine (Chelidonium majus) - different family but similar alkaloids
- Other Papaveraceae - poppy family plants with similar toxic alkaloids
- No safe substitutes for traditional uses
