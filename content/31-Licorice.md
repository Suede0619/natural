- Pregnancy and breastfeeding
- Liver cirrhosis and severe liver disease

### Side Effects
- Elevated blood pressure and sodium retention
- Potassium depletion and muscle weakness
- Fluid retention and edema
- Headache and fatigue with long-term use
- Possible hormonal effects (pseudoaldosteronism)

### Drug Interactions
- Blood pressure medications (may counteract effects)
- Diuretics (may cause potassium loss)
- Digoxin (increased toxicity risk)
- Corticosteroids (may enhance effects)
- Blood-thinning medications

### Special Precautions
- Pregnancy/nursing: Contraindicated due to hormonal effects
- Blood pressure monitoring: Essential with any significant use
- Duration limits: Avoid continuous use beyond 4-6 weeks

## Cultivation & Harvesting

### Growing Conditions

- Light requirements: Full sun to partial shade
- Water needs: Moderate moisture; drought tolerant once established
- Climate zones: USDA zones 7-10

### Harvesting
- Best time to harvest: Roots after 3-4 years in fall when aerial parts die back
- Sustainable harvesting practices: Harvest runner roots while leaving main plant; replant pieces
- Post-harvest processing: Clean roots thoroughly; dry slowly to preserve sweetness

## Conservation Status
- Current conservation status: Stable through cultivation; some wild populations declining
- Threats to wild populations: Over-collection, habitat conversion, climate change
- Sustainable sourcing notes: Widely cultivated; choose certified organic sources
