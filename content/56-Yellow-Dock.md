- Rumicin (antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory)
- Iron (mineral supplementation)
- Oxalic acid (mild astringent; caution in large amounts)
- Chrysarobin (topical antimicrobial)

### Traditional Uses
- Constipation and digestive sluggishness
- Iron deficiency anemia
- Skin conditions including eczema and psoriasis
- Liver congestion and detoxification
- Lymphatic system support
- Chronic inflammatory conditions

### Modern Applications
- Gentle laxative and digestive support

- Anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects
- Blood purification and lymphatic drainage

## Preparation Methods

### Traditional Preparations
- **Tea/Infusion**: 1-2 teaspoons dried root per cup; steep 15-20 minutes
- **Decoction**: 1 tablespoon chopped root per cup; simmer 20-30 minutes
- **Tincture**: 1:5 ratio with 50% alcohol; macerate chopped fresh root 4-6 weeks
- **Poultice**: Fresh crushed root for topical skin applications
- **Oil Infusion**: Dried root in carrier oil for topical anti-inflammatory use

### Dosage Guidelines
- Traditional dosages: 2-4 grams dried root daily; 1-2 cups tea daily
- Duration: Short-term use for acute conditions; cycling for chronic issues

## Safety Information

### Contraindications
- Kidney stones or history of oxalate stones
- Inflammatory bowel disease
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding
- Children under 12 years (due to anthraquinones)

### Side Effects
- Diarrhea with excessive doses
- Electrolyte imbalance with prolonged use
- Kidney irritation in susceptible individuals
- Yellow discoloration of urine (harmless)

### Drug Interactions
- Cardiac glycosides (digoxin) - may increase potassium loss
- Diuretic medications
- Blood-thinning medications (theoretical)
- Medications dependent on intestinal absorption

### Special Precautions
- Pregnancy/nursing: Avoid due to laxative effects and insufficient safety data
- Children's safety: Not recommended under 12 years
- Surgical considerations: Discontinue 2 weeks before surgery
