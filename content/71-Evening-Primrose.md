- Seed oil (standardized GLA content)
- Leaves (traditional use)
- Roots (first-year roots for food and medicine)

### Active Compounds
- Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA; 8-10% of seed oil; anti-inflammatory, hormone-balancing)
- Linoleic acid (omega-6 fatty acid; essential fatty acid)
- Oleic acid (omega-9 fatty acid; cardiovascular health)
- Mucilage (soothing, demulcent)
- Tannins (astringent, anti-inflammatory)
- Sterols (hormone-balancing, anti-inflammatory)

### Traditional Uses
- Women's health and menstrual disorders
- Skin conditions including eczema
- Digestive disorders and stomach upset
- Respiratory ailments and coughs
- Wounds and bruises
- Arthritis and joint inflammation

### Modern Applications
- Atopic dermatitis and eczema
- Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and menopause
- Rheumatoid arthritis and inflammation
- Diabetic neuropathy
- Cardiovascular health support
- Skin health and anti-aging

## Preparation Methods

### Traditional Preparations
- **Seed oil**: Cold-pressed or solvent-extracted; standardized GLA content
- **Tea/Infusion**: 2-3 teaspoons dried leaves per cup; steep 10-15 minutes
- **Tincture**: 1:5 ratio with 40% alcohol; macerate leaves or roots 4 weeks
- **Poultice**: Fresh crushed leaves for topical wound healing
- **Root preparation**: First-year roots cooked as food or medicine

### Dosage Guidelines
- Traditional dosages: 500-1300mg seed oil daily (providing 40-130mg GLA)
- Duration: Safe for long-term use; benefits often require 6-12 weeks

## Safety Information

### Contraindications
- Seizure disorders (theoretical lowering of seizure threshold)
- Scheduled surgery within 2 weeks (bleeding risk)
- Known allergies to evening primrose family

### Side Effects
- Generally very well-tolerated
- Mild digestive upset with large doses
- Headache in some individuals initially
- Possible skin rash in sensitive people

### Drug Interactions
- Anticoagulant medications (may enhance bleeding risk)
- Phenothiazine medications (seizure risk)
- Tamoxifen (may interfere with treatment)

### Special Precautions
- Pregnancy/nursing: Generally safe but consult healthcare provider
- Children's safety: Safe for eczema treatment in children
- Surgical considerations: Discontinue 2 weeks before surgery

## Cultivation & Harvesting

### Growing Conditions
- Soil requirements: Well-drained, sandy soil; tolerates poor soils
- Light requirements: Full sun to partial shade
- Water needs: Low to moderate; very drought tolerant
- Climate zones: Hardy in zones 4-9; self-seeding annual/biennial

### Harvesting
- Best time to harvest: Seeds when capsules begin to open; roots in fall of first year
- Sustainable harvesting practices: Allow some plants to self-seed; harvest sustainably
- Post-harvest processing: Clean seeds thoroughly; oil extraction requires specialized equipment

## Conservation Status
- Current conservation status: Not threatened; widespread and naturalized
- Threats to wild populations: None significant; often considered weedy
- Sustainable sourcing notes: Easy to cultivate; commercially farmed for oil production

## Cultural & Historical Context
- Traditional cultural significance: Important to Native American tribes; "king's cure-all" in Europe
- Historical timeline of use: Centuries of indigenous use; European adoption in 17th century
- Indigenous knowledge acknowledgment: Traditional knowledge from multiple Native American tribes

## Modern Research
- Recent scientific studies: GLA content and anti-inflammatory effects extensively documented
- Clinical trial results: Effective for eczema and PMS symptoms
- Ongoing research areas: Diabetic neuropathy; cardiovascular health; skin aging
