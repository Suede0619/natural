## Medicinal Properties

### Parts Used
- Flowering tops and leaves
- Occasionally roots

### Active Compounds
- Salicylates (salicylic acid, methyl salicylate)
- Tannins (ellagitannins)
- Flavonoids (quercetin, rutin, kaempferol)
- Volatile oils (salicylaldehyde)
- Phenolic glycosides (spiraein)
- Vitamin C

### Traditional Uses
- Pain relief and anti-inflammatory conditions
- Digestive disorders and stomach ulcers
- Rheumatism and arthritis
- Fever reduction
- Kidney and bladder conditions
- Skin conditions and wounds

### Modern Applications
- Natural aspirin alternative for pain relief
- Anti-inflammatory for joint conditions
- Digestive system protection and healing
- Fever reduction without stomach irritation
- Antioxidant and cardiovascular support

## Preparation Methods

### Traditional Preparations
- **Tea/Infusion**: 1-2 tsp dried flowers per cup water, steep 10-15 minutes
- **Decoction**: Root preparations for stronger effects
- **Tincture**: 1:5 ratio in 40% alcohol, 2-4 ml three times daily
- **Poultice**: Fresh crushed flowers and leaves for topical application
- **Oil infusion**: For external skin applications

### Dosage Guidelines
- Traditional dosages: 2-3 cups tea daily for acute conditions
- Duration: Short-term use for acute pain, longer for chronic conditions

## Safety Information

### Contraindications
- Salicylate allergy or aspirin sensitivity
- Active gastric or duodenal ulcers
- Severe kidney or liver disease
- Children under 16 (due to salicylate content)

### Side Effects
- Possible gastric irritation with large doses
- Nausea in sensitive individuals
- Potential bleeding with very high doses
- Rare allergic reactions

### Drug Interactions
- May enhance effects of blood-thinning medications
- Possible interactions with diabetes medications
- May increase effects of other anti-inflammatory drugs
- Caution with kidney medications

### Special Precautions
- Pregnancy/nursing: Generally considered safe but consult healthcare provider
- Children's safety: Avoid in children under 16 due to salicylate content
- Surgical considerations: Discontinue 1 week before surgery

## Cultivation & Harvesting

### Growing Conditions
- Soil: Moist to wet, fertile soil with good organic content
- Light: Full sun to partial shade
- Water: Requires consistent moisture, tolerates seasonal flooding
- Climate zones: USDA zones 3-9

### Harvesting
- Best time: During peak flowering for highest salicylate content
- Sustainable practices: Cut flowering stems, leave roots to regenerate
- Post-harvest: Dry quickly to preserve color and active compounds

## Conservation Status
- Generally stable in native range
- Naturalized populations established in North America
- Some local declines due to wetland drainage

## Cultural & Historical Context
- Sacred to ancient Celtic druids and used in ceremonies
- Traditional strewing herb in medieval times for its fragrance
- Source of salicylic acid, precursor to aspirin development
- Featured prominently in European folk medicine

## Modern Research
- Studies on anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties
- Research into gastroprotective effects
- Investigation of antioxidant and cardiovascular benefits
- Clinical studies comparing to synthetic salicylates

## Related Species
- Filipendula vulgaris (Dropwort) - similar properties, different habitat
- Spiraea species - closely related with some similar compounds
- Gaultheria procumbens (Wintergreen) - different family, similar salicylates
- Salix species (Willows) - different family, related salicylate content
