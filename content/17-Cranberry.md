## Plant Description

### Overall Appearance
Low-growing, evergreen shrub forming dense mats with trailing stems and small, dark green leaves; produces distinctive red berries in fall.

### Roots

Small, pink to white nodding flowers with four reflexed petals resembling a crane's head; flowers bloom in late spring to early summer on short upright shoots.

### Fruits/Seeds
Bright red, tart berries 1/4 to 1/2 inch in diameter with four air pockets that help them float; berries ripen in fall and can persist through winter.
