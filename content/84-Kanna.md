## Medicinal Properties

### Parts Used
- Aerial parts (stems and leaves)
- Traditionally fermented plant material

### Active Compounds
- Mesembrine alkaloids (mesembrine, mesembrenone, mesembrenol)

- Tannins
- Flavonoids
- Oxalic acid

### Traditional Uses

- **Chewed fresh**: Small amounts chewed for immediate effects
- **Smoked**: Dried plant material smoked in small amounts
- **Tea/Infusion**: 200-400mg fermented material per cup
- **Tincture**: Alcohol extraction of fermented material

### Dosage Guidelines
- Traditional dosages: Very small amounts (50-200mg fermented material)
- Duration: Occasional use, not for daily long-term consumption

## Safety Information

### Contraindications
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding
- History of heart conditions
