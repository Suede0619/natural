# Reishi Mushroom (Ganoderma lucidum)

## Basic Information
- **Latin Name**: Ganoderma lucidum
- **Common Names**: Reishi, Lingzhi, Mannentake, Varnish Shelf, Lacquered Polypore, Glossy Ganoderma, "Mushroom of Immortality"
- **Plant Family**: Ganodermataceae (Polypore family)
- **Native Range**: Asia, Europe, North America (on hardwood trees)
- **Habitat**: Parasitic and saprophytic on hardwood trees, especially oak, maple, and elm; prefers humid forest environments

## Plant Description

### Overall Appearance
Large, woody bracket fungus with a distinctive glossy, varnish-like surface; kidney-shaped cap with white to yellowish margin when young, becoming reddish-brown to mahogany colored.

### Roots
No true roots; instead has extensive mycelium (thread-like fungal networks) that penetrate host wood and soil; mycelium is white to cream colored.

### Stem
Varies from nearly absent to well-developed lateral stem; when present, stem is glossy, hard, and the same color as the cap; can be up to 6 inches long.

### Leaves
No leaves; reproductive structure consists of pores on the underside of the cap that release spores; pore surface is white when young, becoming brown.

### Flowers
No flowers; reproduces via microscopic spores released from pores; spores are brown and have a distinctive double wall structure with intricate patterns.

### Fruits/Seeds
The entire mushroom is the fruiting body; spores serve as reproductive "seeds"; mature specimens release billions of spores that appear as brown dust.

## Cultivation & Harvesting

### Growing Conditions
- Soil requirements: Rich, organic matter on hardwood substrates
- Light requirements: Shade to partial shade; indirect light
- Water needs: High humidity (80-95%); consistent moisture
- Climate zones: Controlled environment cultivation; naturally in temperate forests

### Harvesting
- Best time to harvest: When cap margin changes from white to brown
- Sustainable harvesting practices: Cultivated commercially; wild harvest should be sustainable
- Post-harvest processing: Dry immediately; grind to powder or prepare extracts

## Conservation Status
- Current conservation status: Stable through cultivation; wild populations vary by region
- Threats to wild populations: Deforestation, habitat loss, over-collection
- Sustainable sourcing notes: Extensively cultivated; choose certified organic sources
