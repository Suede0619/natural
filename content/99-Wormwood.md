# Wormwood (Artemisia absinthium)

## Basic Information
- **Latin Name**: Artemisia absinthium
- **Common Names**: Wormwood, Grand Wormwood, Absinthe, Green Ginger, Absinth Wormwood
- **Plant Family**: Asteraceae (Sunflower/Daisy family)
- **Native Range**: Europe, Asia, and northern Africa, naturalized in temperate regions worldwide
- **Habitat**: Dry, rocky soils, waste places, roadsides, and disturbed areas in temperate climates

## Plant Description

### Overall Appearance
Wormwood is a aromatic perennial herb growing 2-4 feet tall with silvery-gray foliage and an intensely bitter taste.

### Roots
Deep taproot system with some lateral spreading, adapted to dry conditions and poor soils.

### Stem
Erect, woody stems at base are covered with fine silky hairs giving the plant its characteristic silvery appearance.

### Leaves
Deeply divided, fern-like leaves are silvery-gray on both sides due to dense, silky hairs. Leaves become less divided toward flower clusters.

### Flowers
Small, yellow-green flower heads are arranged in loose panicles. Individual flowers are tiny and inconspicuous.

### Fruits/Seeds
Small, smooth achenes lack the bristly pappus found in many Asteraceae family members.

## Medicinal Properties

### Parts Used
- Aerial parts (leaves, stems, flowers)
- Leaves are typically preferred

### Active Compounds
- Essential oils (thujone - alpha and beta forms, camphor, chamazulene)
- Sesquiterpene lactones (absinthin, artabsin, anabsinthin)
- Flavonoids (quercetin, rutin, artemisinin)
- Phenolic acids
- Bitter principles (absinthin - extremely bitter)
- Azulenes

### Traditional Uses
- Digestive disorders and poor appetite
- Intestinal parasites and worms
- Liver and gallbladder conditions
- Fever and malaria
- Menstrual irregularities
- Alcoholic beverage production (absinthe)

### Modern Applications
- Bitter digestive tonic and appetite stimulant
- Liver support and detoxification
- Antimicrobial and antiparasitic effects
- Limited therapeutic use due to thujone toxicity
- Research into antimalarial compounds

## Preparation Methods

### Traditional Preparations
- **Tea/Infusion**: 1/2 tsp dried herb per cup water, steep 10-15 minutes
- **Tincture**: 1:10 ratio in 45% alcohol, 5-10 drops three times daily
- **Wine**: Traditional European preparation for digestive conditions
- **External wash**: Strong tea for wounds and skin conditions
- **Absinthe**: Alcoholic beverage (now regulated due to thujone)

### Dosage Guidelines
- Very small doses only due to thujone toxicity
- Tea: No more than 1 cup daily for short periods
- Professional guidance recommended for any internal use

## Safety Information

### Contraindications
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding (abortifacient properties)
- Epilepsy or seizure disorders
- Liver disease
- Porphyria
- Children

### Side Effects
- Thujone toxicity (seizures, hallucinations, kidney damage)
- Severe allergic reactions possible
- Gastrointestinal irritation
- Potential neurotoxicity with prolonged use

### Drug Interactions
- May interact with anticonvulsant medications
- Possible interactions with liver medications
- May affect blood clotting medications
- Caution with other neurotoxic substances

### Special Precautions
- Thujone content: Extremely toxic in larger doses
- Professional supervision: Recommended for any therapeutic use
- Duration: Only short-term use, if any
- Pregnancy: Strictly contraindicated

## Cultivation & Harvesting

### Growing Conditions
- Soil: Well-drained, poor to moderate fertility, alkaline preferred
- Light: Full sun
- Water: Drought-tolerant, minimal watering needed
- Climate zones: USDA zones 4-9

### Harvesting
- Best time: Before flowering when bitter compounds are highest
- Sustainable practices: Cut aerial parts, leave root system intact
- Post-harvest: Dry quickly to preserve volatile oils

## Conservation Status
- Common and widespread in suitable habitats
- Not of conservation concern
- Can become weedy in some regions

## Cultural & Historical Context
- Sacred to ancient Egyptians and Greeks
- Traditional ingredient in European bitter liqueurs
- Source of absinthe, the "Green Fairy" of 19th-century Europe
- Banned in many countries due to thujone toxicity concerns

## Modern Research
- Studies on thujone toxicity and safety limits
- Research into antimicrobial and antiparasitic properties
- Investigation of liver protective compounds
- Studies on artemisinin derivatives for malaria

## Related Species
- Artemisia annua (Sweet Annie) - source of antimalarial artemisinin
- Artemisia vulgaris (Mugwort) - lower thujone content, safer use
- Artemisia tridentata (Sagebrush) - North American native
- Other bitter Artemisia species with medicinal properties
