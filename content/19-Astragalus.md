- Chemotherapy side effect reduction
- Diabetes management and blood sugar control
- Kidney disease support
- Anti-aging and telomerase activation

## Preparation Methods

### Traditional Preparations
- **Decoction**: 9-30 grams dried root per day, simmered 30-60 minutes
- **Tea/Infusion**: 1-2 teaspoons powdered root per cup hot water, steep 15 minutes
- **Tincture**: 1:5 ratio in 40% alcohol, 3-5 ml three times daily
- **Powder**: 1-3 grams powdered root daily in water or food
- **Soup**: Traditional Chinese preparation with other herbs and foods

### Dosage Guidelines
- Traditional dosages: 9-30 grams dried root daily in decoction or equivalent standardized extract
- Duration: Can be used long-term as a tonic; effects build gradually over weeks to months

## Safety Information

### Contraindications
- Autoimmune diseases (may overstimulate immune system)
- Acute infections or fever (traditional contraindication)
- Organ transplant recipients taking immunosuppressive drugs

### Side Effects
- Generally well-tolerated with minimal side effects
- Rare allergic reactions in sensitive individuals
- Possible interactions with immunosuppressive medications
- Mild gastrointestinal upset in some users

### Drug Interactions
- Immunosuppressive medications (may counteract effects)
- Blood thinning medications (potential interaction)
- Diabetes medications (may enhance blood sugar lowering)
- Lithium (may affect kidney clearance)

### Special Precautions
- Pregnancy/nursing: Traditional use suggests safety, but consult healthcare provider
- Children: Generally safe with appropriate dosing
- Autoimmune conditions: Use with caution and professional guidance

## Cultivation & Harvesting

### Growing Conditions
- Soil requirements: Well-drained, sandy loam soil; pH 7.0-8.5
- Light requirements: Full sun to partial shade
- Water needs: Moderate water; drought tolerant once established
- Climate zones: USDA zones 4-8, adapted to cold winters

### Harvesting
- Best time to harvest: Roots after 4-7 years in fall when above-ground parts die back
- Sustainable harvesting practices: Allow plants to fully mature; replant or reseed areas
- Post-harvest processing: Clean, slice, and dry roots thoroughly; store in cool, dry conditions

## Conservation Status
- Current conservation status: Stable in cultivation; wild populations under some pressure
- Threats to wild populations: Over-collection, habitat conversion, climate change
- Sustainable sourcing notes: Increasingly cultivated; choose certified sustainable sources

## Cultural & Historical Context
- Traditional cultural significance: One of the most important herbs in Traditional Chinese Medicine
- Historical timeline of use: Used in China for over 2,000 years; first mentioned in Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing
- Indigenous knowledge acknowledgment: Traditional Chinese and Mongolian medicinal knowledge

## Modern Research
- Recent scientific studies: Extensive research on immune, cardiovascular, and anti-aging effects
- Clinical trial results: Promising results for heart failure, diabetes, and chemotherapy support
- Ongoing research areas: Telomerase activation, neuroprotection, cancer treatment support
