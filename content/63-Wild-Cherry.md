## Basic Information
- **Latin Name**: Prunus serotina
- **Common Names**: Wild cherry, Black cherry, Rum cherry, Mountain black cherry
- **Plant Family**: Rosaceae (Rose family)
- **Native Range**: Eastern North America from Canada to Central America
- **Habitat**: Deciduous forests; forest edges; well-drained soils; full sun to partial shade

## Plant Description

### Overall Appearance
Deciduous tree reaching 50-80 feet tall with distinctive bark and drooping clusters of white flowers.

### Roots
Deep taproot with extensive lateral root system; forms root suckers creating groves.

### Stem
Bark distinctive: smooth and dark on young trees, becoming furrowed and plated on mature trees; inner bark aromatic.

### Leaves
Alternate, simple leaves 2-5 inches long; serrated margins; glossy dark green above, lighter beneath.

### Flowers
Small white flowers in drooping racemes 4-6 inches long; appear in late spring after leaves.

### Fruits/Seeds
Small, dark purple to black cherries; astringent taste; contain single pit; important wildlife food.

## Medicinal Properties

### Parts Used
- Inner bark (primary medicinal use)
- Dried bark strips
- Root bark (occasionally)
- Bark tinctures and extracts

### Active Compounds
- Prunasin (cyanogenic glycoside; releases hydrogen cyanide when metabolized)
- Amygdalin (cyanogenic glycoside; antitussive properties)
- Tannins (astringent, anti-inflammatory)
- Volatile oils (aromatic, expectorant)
- Benzoic acid (antimicrobial, preservative)
- Quercetin (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory)

### Traditional Uses
- Coughs and respiratory ailments
- Bronchitis and asthma
- Digestive disorders and diarrhea
- Fever reduction
- Sedative for nervous conditions
- Cold and flu symptoms

### Modern Applications
- Cough suppression and respiratory support
- Expectorant for chest congestion
- Anti-inflammatory effects
- Mild sedative properties
- Digestive support (astringent effects)
- Traditional cold and flu remedy

## Preparation Methods

### Traditional Preparations
- **Tea/Infusion**: 1 teaspoon dried inner bark per cup; steep 15 minutes
- **Decoction**: Bark simmered 20 minutes for stronger respiratory effects
- **Tincture**: 1:5 ratio with 50% alcohol; macerate dried bark 4 weeks
- **Syrup**: Traditional cough syrup with honey and bark decoction
- **Cold infusion**: Bark soaked in cold water overnight for milder effects

### Dosage Guidelines
- Traditional dosages: 1-3 grams dried bark daily; 2-3 cups tea daily
- Duration: Short-term use for acute respiratory symptoms

## Safety Information

### Contraindications
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding (cyanogenic glycosides)
- Children under 6 years (cyanide concerns)
- Liver disease (processing burden)
- Large doses (cyanide toxicity)

### Side Effects
- Nausea and digestive upset with large doses
- Potential cyanide toxicity with excessive use
- Drowsiness (intended sedative effect)
- Allergic reactions in sensitive individuals

### Drug Interactions
- Sedative medications (may enhance effects)
- Liver-metabolized drugs
- MAO inhibitors (theoretical interaction)
- Respiratory depressants

### Special Precautions
- Pregnancy/nursing: Avoid due to cyanogenic glycosides
- Children's safety: Not recommended under 6 years
- Surgical considerations: May enhance anesthesia effects

## Cultivation & Harvesting

### Growing Conditions
- Soil requirements: Well-drained, fertile soil; tolerates various conditions
- Light requirements: Full sun to partial shade
- Water needs: Moderate moisture; drought tolerant once established
- Climate zones: Hardy in zones 3-9; adaptable tree

### Harvesting
- Best time to harvest: Inner bark in spring when sap is rising
- Sustainable harvesting practices: Never girdle tree; take small sections only
- Post-harvest processing: Dry bark strips quickly to preserve compounds

## Conservation Status
- Current conservation status: Common and widespread; not threatened
- Threats to wild populations: None significant; fast-growing species
- Sustainable sourcing notes: Harvest sustainably; tree recovers well from pruning

## Cultural & Historical Context
- Traditional cultural significance: Important to Native American tribes for food and medicine
- Historical timeline of use: Centuries of indigenous use; colonial period adoption
- Indigenous knowledge acknowledgment: Traditional knowledge from multiple tribal nations

## Modern Research
- Recent scientific studies: Antitussive and expectorant properties confirmed
- Clinical trial results: Limited modern research; traditional safety profile established
- Ongoing research areas: Respiratory health; cough suppression mechanisms; safety studies
