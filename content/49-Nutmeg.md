- **Common Names**: Nutmeg, Mace (aril), Pala, Muscade, Jaiphal
- **Plant Family**: Myristicaceae (Nutmeg family)
- **Native Range**: Banda Islands (Moluccas) of Indonesia
- **Habitat**: Tropical maritime climate; rich, well-drained volcanic soils; high humidity

## Plant Description

### Overall Appearance
Evergreen tree reaching 40-60 feet in height with dense, pyramidal crown and aromatic bark; dioecious (separate male and female trees).

### Roots
Deep taproot system with extensive lateral roots; mycorrhizal associations enhance nutrient uptake in tropical soils.

### Stem
Straight trunk with smooth, grayish-brown bark; aromatic when cut; branches in regular whorls creating symmetrical crown.

### Leaves
Alternate, simple leaves 3-5 inches long; elliptical shape with entire margins; dark green above, lighter beneath; aromatic when crushed.

### Flowers
Small, pale yellow flowers; males in clusters, females solitary or in small groups; bell-shaped with 3-4 petals; fragrant.

### Fruits/Seeds
Large, yellow to orange fruit splitting to reveal seed (nutmeg) surrounded by red aril (mace); fruit resembles an apricot.

## Medicinal Properties

### Parts Used
- Seeds (nutmeg - primary medicinal and culinary use)
- Aril (mace - similar properties, different flavor)
- Essential oil from seeds
- Seed butter (nutmeg butter)

### Active Compounds
- Myristicin (15-20% of essential oil; psychoactive, hepatotoxic in large doses)
- Elemicin (psychoactive compound; CNS effects)
- Safrole (aromatic compound; potential carcinogen)
- Eugenol (anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial)
- Camphene (antimicrobial, analgesic)
- Pinene (bronchodilator, memory enhancement)

### Traditional Uses
- Digestive disorders and nausea
- Insomnia and nervous disorders
- Arthritis and joint pain
- Respiratory ailments including asthma
- Male reproductive health and libido
- Cognitive enhancement and memory

### Modern Applications
- Mild sedative and sleep support
- Digestive health and gastric protection
- Anti-inflammatory and pain relief
- Antimicrobial and antifungal properties
- Cognitive function research (low doses)
- Traditional topical pain relief

## Preparation Methods

### Traditional Preparations
- **Tea/Infusion**: 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg per cup hot milk or water; steep 10 minutes
- **Decoction**: Small amounts simmered briefly (avoid prolonged heating)
- **Tincture**: 1:10 ratio with 70% alcohol; macerate grated nutmeg 4 weeks
- **Poultice**: Ground nutmeg mixed with oil for topical pain relief
- **Oil Infusion**: Small amounts in carrier oil; use sparingly topically

### Dosage Guidelines
- Traditional dosages: 1-3 grams daily maximum; 1/4 teaspoon per dose
- Duration: Occasional use only; not for long-term daily consumption

## Safety Information

### Contraindications
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding (abortifacient properties)
- Liver disease (hepatotoxic compounds)
- Mental health disorders (psychoactive effects)
- Children under 6 years old

### Side Effects
- Nausea and vomiting with moderate doses (5+ grams)
- Hallucinations and delirium with large doses (10+ grams)
- Liver toxicity with chronic excessive use
- Rapid heart rate and elevated blood pressure

### Drug Interactions
- CNS depressants (may enhance sedative effects)
- Liver-metabolized medications
- MAO inhibitors (potential dangerous interactions)
- Anticoagulant medications

### Special Precautions
- Pregnancy/nursing: AVOID - can cause miscarriage and is unsafe while nursing
- Children's safety: Small culinary amounts only; avoid medicinal doses
- Surgical considerations: Discontinue 2 weeks before surgery

## Cultivation & Harvesting

### Growing Conditions
- Soil requirements: Rich, well-drained volcanic soil with high organic content
- Light requirements: Partial shade when young; filtered sunlight when mature
- Water needs: High humidity; consistent rainfall; excellent drainage
- Climate zones: Tropical maritime climates only; no frost tolerance

### Harvesting
- Best time to harvest: Fruits collected when they split naturally (7-9 months after flowering)
- Sustainable harvesting practices: Hand-picking preserves tree health
- Post-harvest processing: Mace removed immediately; nutmeg dried slowly for 6-8 weeks

## Conservation Status
- Current conservation status: Wild populations rare; cultivated in limited regions
- Threats to wild populations: Habitat destruction and climate change
- Sustainable sourcing notes: Support traditional agroforestry systems

## Cultural & Historical Context
- Traditional cultural significance: Sacred to Indonesian cultures; ancient trade catalyst
- Historical timeline of use: European spice trade monopolies; colonial exploitation
- Indigenous knowledge acknowledgment: Traditional Banda Islander cultivation knowledge

## Modern Research
- Recent scientific studies: Antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties confirmed
- Clinical trial results: Limited due to toxicity concerns at therapeutic doses
- Ongoing research areas: Neuroprotection at very low doses; antimicrobial applications

## Related Species
- Wild nutmeg (Myristica argentea) - similar properties, different potency
- Bombay mace (Myristica malabarica) - Indian variety with different chemistry
- California nutmeg (Torreya californica) - unrelated despite name
