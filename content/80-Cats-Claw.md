- **Plant Family**: Rubiaceae (Coffee family)
- **Native Range**: Amazon rainforest of Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Brazil
- **Habitat**: Primary and secondary rainforest, climbing high into the canopy on large trees

## Plant Description

### Overall Appearance
Cat's claw is a woody vine that can climb 100 feet or more into rainforest canopy using its distinctive hook-like thorns.

### Roots
The root system includes both fibrous roots and the thick, woody main root. The root bark is the primary source of medicinal compounds.

### Stem
Woody, climbing stems can reach several inches in diameter. The vine is characterized by curved, claw-like thorns that help it climb.

### Leaves
Opposite, oval leaves are 3-5 inches long with prominent veins. Leaves are dark green and glossy with smooth margins.

### Flowers
Small, white to yellowish flowers appear in spherical clusters at branch tips. Flowers are tubular and fragrant.

### Fruits/Seeds
Small capsules split to release numerous tiny seeds with feathery appendages for wind dispersal.

## Medicinal Properties

### Parts Used
- Root bark (primary medicinal part)
- Inner bark of stems
- Leaves (less commonly used)

### Active Compounds
- Oxindole alkaloids (isopteropodine, pteropodine, mitraphylline)
- Quinovic acid glycosides
- Polyphenols and tannins
- Triterpenes
- Plant sterols
- Procyanidin B1, B2, B4

### Traditional Uses
- Immune system support and infections
- Arthritis and joint inflammation
- Digestive disorders and ulcers
- Cancer and tumor conditions
- Wounds and skin conditions
- Contraception (traditional use)

### Modern Applications
- Immune system modulation
- Anti-inflammatory for arthritis
- Antioxidant supplementation
- Digestive health support
- Complementary cancer therapy (under professional guidance)

## Preparation Methods

### Traditional Preparations
- **Tea/Infusion**: 1 tsp inner bark per cup water, steep 15-20 minutes
- **Decoction**: Simmer 1 tbsp bark in 3 cups water for 15 minutes
- **Tincture**: 1:5 ratio in 50% alcohol, 1-3 ml three times daily
- **Capsules**: Standardized extract preparations
- **Poultice**: Ground bark mixed with water for topical use

### Dosage Guidelines
- Traditional dosages: 1-2 cups tea daily
- Duration: Typically used for several weeks to months

## Safety Information

### Contraindications
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding
- Autoimmune diseases (may stimulate immune system)
- Organ transplant recipients
- Children under 3 years old

### Side Effects
- Mild digestive upset
- Headache and dizziness
- Low blood pressure
- Possible immune system overstimulation

### Drug Interactions
- May interact with immunosuppressive medications
- Possible interactions with blood pressure medications
- May enhance effects of blood-thinning medications
- Caution with chemotherapy drugs

### Special Precautions
- Pregnancy/nursing: Contraindicated due to traditional contraceptive use
- Children's safety: Use only under professional guidance for children over 3

## Cultivation & Harvesting

### Growing Conditions
- Soil: Rich, well-drained rainforest soil with high organic content
- Light: Filtered sunlight, partial shade
- Water: High humidity and consistent moisture
- Climate zones: Tropical rainforest conditions only

### Harvesting
- Best time: Dry season for easier access and processing
- Sustainable practices: Only harvest mature vines, allow regeneration
- Post-harvest: Dry inner bark carefully to preserve alkaloids

## Conservation Status
- Vulnerable to overharvesting due to increasing demand
- Habitat loss from deforestation threatens wild populations
- Sustainable cultivation projects being developed
- CITES listing considered for some regions

## Cultural & Historical Context
- Used for over 2,000 years by indigenous Amazonian peoples
- Traditional "sacred plant" in Peruvian indigenous medicine
- Introduced to Western herbalism in 1970s by Klaus Keplinger
- Important economically for local communities

## Modern Research
- Extensive studies on oxindole alkaloids and immune effects
- Clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis
- Research into antiviral and antimicrobial properties
- Studies on neuroprotective and anti-aging effects

## Related Species
- Uncaria guianensis (alternative cat's claw species)
- Uncaria rhynchophylla (Chinese cat's claw) - different alkaloid profile
- Other Uncaria species with varying medicinal properties
- Mitragyna speciosa (Kratom) - related but very different effects
