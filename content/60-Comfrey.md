## Medicinal Properties

### Parts Used
- Leaves (external use only due to safety concerns)
- Roots (traditional internal use now discouraged)
- Fresh plant juice (external use)
- Dried aerial parts (external preparations)

### Active Compounds
- Allantoin (cell proliferation, wound healing)
- Mucilage (soothing, protective, anti-inflammatory)
- Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (hepatotoxic; limit internal use)
- Rosmarinic acid (anti-inflammatory, antioxidant)
- Tannins (astringent, wound healing)
- Choline (cellular function, nerve health)

### Traditional Uses
- Bone fractures and bone healing
- Wounds, cuts, and bruises
- Sprains and muscle injuries
- Skin conditions and ulcers
- Respiratory ailments (historically internal)
- Digestive disorders (historically internal)

### Modern Applications
- External wound healing and tissue repair
- Topical anti-inflammatory for injuries
- Skin conditions and dermatitis (external only)
- Bruises and soft tissue trauma
- Joint and muscle pain (external application)
- Osteoarthritis support (topical preparations)

## Preparation Methods

### Traditional Preparations
- **Tea/Infusion**: EXTERNAL USE ONLY - 2-3 teaspoons dried leaves per cup for compresses
- **Decoction**: EXTERNAL USE ONLY - roots simmered for poultices
- **Tincture**: EXTERNAL USE ONLY - 1:5 ratio with 40% alcohol
- **Poultice**: Fresh crushed leaves applied directly to injuries
- **Oil Infusion**: Dried leaves in carrier oil for topical anti-inflammatory use

### Dosage Guidelines
- Traditional dosages: EXTERNAL USE ONLY due to pyrrolizidine alkaloid content
- Duration: Topical use safe for short-term application

## Safety Information

### Contraindications
- Internal use (oral consumption) due to liver toxicity
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding
- Liver disease or dysfunction
- Open wounds (may promote healing too rapidly, trapping infection)

### Side Effects
- Liver damage with internal use (pyrrolizidine alkaloids)
- Skin sensitivity in some individuals with topical use
- Rapid wound closure may trap debris or infection

### Drug Interactions
- Liver-metabolized medications (if used internally)
- No significant interactions with external use

### Special Precautions
- Pregnancy/nursing: Avoid all use due to pyrrolizidine alkaloids
- Children's safety: External use only with supervision
- Surgical considerations: Do not use on fresh surgical wounds

## Cultivation & Harvesting

### Growing Conditions
- Soil requirements: Rich, moist, organic soil with pH 6.0-7.0
- Light requirements: Partial shade to full sun
- Water needs: Consistent moisture; tolerates wet conditions
- Climate zones: Hardy in zones 3-9; may be invasive in ideal conditions

### Harvesting
- Best time to harvest: Leaves throughout growing season; roots in fall
- Sustainable harvesting practices: Harvest outer leaves; very aggressive grower
- Post-harvest processing: Dry quickly to preserve active compounds

## Conservation Status
- Current conservation status: Not threatened; widely cultivated
- Threats to wild populations: None; often considered invasive
- Sustainable sourcing notes: Easy to grow; contains spread to prevent invasiveness

## Cultural & Historical Context
- Traditional cultural significance: "Knitbone" - traditional bone healing herb
- Historical timeline of use: Ancient Greek and Roman medicine; medieval monastery gardens
- Indigenous knowledge acknowledgment: Traditional European knowledge; adopted globally

## Modern Research
- Recent scientific studies: Topical wound healing and anti-inflammatory effects confirmed
- Clinical trial results: Effective for osteoarthritis pain when used topically
- Ongoing research areas: Topical formulations; wound healing mechanisms; safety profiles
