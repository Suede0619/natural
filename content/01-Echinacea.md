- Known allergies to plants in Asteraceae family

### Side Effects
- Rare allergic reactions including rash, difficulty breathing
- Gastrointestinal upset in sensitive individuals
- Dizziness or headache with excessive use
- Potential immune system overstimulation

### Drug Interactions
- May interfere with immunosuppressive medications
- Potential interaction with hepatotoxic drugs
- May affect metabolism of certain medications

- Light requirements: Full sun to partial shade
- Water needs: Drought tolerant once established, moderate water during growth
- Climate zones: USDA zones 3-8

### Harvesting
- Best time to harvest: Roots in fall after 3-4 years; aerial parts during flowering
- Sustainable harvesting practices: Harvest only 1/3 of aerial parts, allow regeneration
- Post-harvest processing: Clean and dry roots; fresh preparations most potent

## Conservation Status
- Current conservation status: Generally stable but declining in some wild areas
- Threats to wild populations: Habitat loss, over-collection
- Sustainable sourcing notes: Widely cultivated; choose certified organic sources
