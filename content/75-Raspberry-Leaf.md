## Plant Description

### Overall Appearance
Raspberry is a deciduous shrub growing 3-6 feet tall with arching canes (stems) that live for two years. Forms colonies through root suckers.

### Roots
Perennial root system with shallow, spreading roots that produce numerous suckers, creating new canes each year.

White to pale pink flowers appear in clusters on second-year canes in late spring. Flowers have 5 petals and numerous stamens.

### Fruits/Seeds
Aggregate fruits (raspberries) are red when ripe, composed of many small drupelets, each containing a tiny seed.
