## Basic Information
- **Latin Name**: Stellaria media
- **Common Names**: Chickweed, Common Chickweed, Starwort, Winterweed, Stitchwort
- **Plant Family**: Caryophyllaceae (Pink family)
- **Native Range**: Europe, naturalized worldwide in temperate regions
- **Habitat**: Gardens, lawns, waste places, cultivated ground, and disturbed soils

## Plant Description

### Overall Appearance
Chickweed is a low-growing annual herb that forms dense mats, typically 2-8 inches tall with sprawling, weak stems.

### Roots
Shallow, fibrous root system adapted to quick establishment in disturbed or cultivated soils.

### Stem
Weak, trailing stems are round with a distinctive line of hairs running along one side that alternates at each node.

### Leaves
Small, opposite, oval leaves are 1/4 to 1/2 inch long with pointed tips. Lower leaves have short petioles while upper leaves are sessile.

### Flowers
Tiny white flowers have 5 deeply notched petals that appear as 10 separate petals. Flowers are star-shaped, hence "starwort."

### Fruits/Seeds
Small capsules contain numerous tiny, reddish-brown seeds that are an important food source for birds.

## Medicinal Properties

### Parts Used
- Aerial parts (stems, leaves, flowers)
- Fresh plant preferred over dried

### Active Compounds
- Saponins (stellarin)
- Flavonoids (rutin, quercetin)
- Vitamin C (high content)
- Minerals (potassium, calcium, magnesium)
- Coumarins
- Plant sterols

### Traditional Uses
- Skin conditions and eczema
- Wounds, cuts, and burns
- Eye irritations and conjunctivitis
- Digestive inflammation
- Respiratory conditions and coughs
- Rheumatism and joint pain

### Modern Applications
- Topical anti-inflammatory for skin conditions
- Wound healing and tissue repair
- Nutritional supplement (high vitamin C)
- Cooling and soothing applications
- Natural food source (edible greens)

## Preparation Methods

### Traditional Preparations
- **Fresh juice**: Crushed fresh plant applied directly to skin
- **Poultice**: Fresh crushed herb applied to wounds and inflammation
- **Tea/Infusion**: 1-2 tsp fresh herb per cup water, steep 10 minutes
- **Oil infusion**: Fresh herb infused in olive oil for topical use
- **Compress**: Cloth soaked in strong tea applied to affected areas

### Dosage Guidelines
- Fresh consumption: Small amounts as food/salad green
- Topical use: Apply fresh preparations as needed
- Tea: 1-2 cups daily when using medicinally

## Safety Information

### Contraindications
- None known for typical external use
- Large internal consumption may cause digestive upset
- Avoid if allergic to plants in Caryophyllaceae family

### Side Effects
- Generally very well-tolerated
- Possible mild digestive upset with large quantities
- Rare skin sensitivity in some individuals

### Drug Interactions
- No significant interactions reported
- High vitamin C content may enhance iron absorption
- Generally considered very safe

### Special Precautions
- Pregnancy/nursing: Safe as food, no concerns with typical use
- Children's safety: Very safe, often consumed by children
- Identification: Ensure correct identification as several look-alike plants exist

## Cultivation & Harvesting

### Growing Conditions
- Soil: Tolerates various soil types, prefers moist, fertile conditions
- Light: Full sun to partial shade
- Water: Moderate moisture, somewhat drought-tolerant
- Climate zones: Annual that grows in most temperate regions

### Harvesting
- Best time: Throughout growing season, best when young and tender
- Sustainable practices: Cut above ground level, allows regrowth
- Post-harvest: Use fresh immediately or dry quickly for storage

## Conservation Status
- Extremely common and widespread, not of conservation concern
- Considered a beneficial weed by many gardeners
- Important early food source for wildlife and pollinators

## Cultural & Historical Context
- Used as food and medicine throughout European history
- Traditional "poor man's food" during times of scarcity
- Featured in British folk medicine for skin conditions
- Continues to be used in modern wild food foraging

## Modern Research
- Studies on anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties
- Research into antioxidant content and nutritional value
- Investigation of saponin content and biological activity
- Studies on traditional skin condition applications
