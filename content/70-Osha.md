- **Habitat**: Alpine and subalpine zones; moist, rich soils; elevations 7,000-12,000 feet

## Plant Description

### Overall Appearance
Perennial herb growing 1-4 feet tall with compound umbel flowers and distinctive aromatic root system.

### Roots
Large, thick, branching root system; brown exterior with white interior; intensely aromatic and spicy.

### Stem
Hollow, ridged stems characteristic of carrot family; purplish coloration; branching in upper portions.

### Leaves
Compound leaves divided into three leaflets; each leaflet further divided; serrated margins; alternate arrangement.

### Flowers
Small white to pinkish flowers arranged in compound umbels; appear in mid to late summer.

### Fruits/Seeds
Small, ribbed seeds typical of carrot family; aromatic when crushed; wind and gravity dispersed.

## Medicinal Properties

### Parts Used
- Roots (primary and traditional medicinal use)
- Fresh or dried root preparations
- Root tinctures and extracts
- Powdered root (traditional chewing)

### Active Compounds
- Volatile oils (phthalides, including ligustilide; respiratory, circulatory effects)
- Coumarins (angelicin, bergapten; photosensitizing, antimicrobial)
- Ferulic acid (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory)
- Falcarinol (polyacetylene; antimicrobial, immune-stimulating)
- Essential oils (respiratory expectorant effects)
- Phenolic compounds (antioxidant, protective)

### Traditional Uses
- Respiratory ailments including altitude sickness
- Viral infections and immune support
- Digestive disorders and stomach upset
- Circulation and cardiovascular support
- Spiritual purification and ceremony
- Snake bite and venomous bites (traditional)

### Modern Applications
- High-altitude respiratory support
- Immune system stimulation
- Antiviral and antimicrobial effects
- Respiratory tract infections
- Circulatory support and cardiovascular health
- Adaptogenic and stress-response support

## Preparation Methods

### Traditional Preparations
- **Chewing root**: Small pieces chewed directly for immediate respiratory effects
- **Tea/Infusion**: 1/2 teaspoon dried root per cup; steep 15-20 minutes
- **Decoction**: Root simmered 20-30 minutes for stronger medicinal effects
- **Tincture**: 1:5 ratio with 60% alcohol; macerate fresh or dried root 6 weeks
- **Smoking blend**: Traditionally mixed with other herbs for respiratory support

### Dosage Guidelines
- Traditional dosages: 1-3 grams dried root daily; small pieces as needed for chewing
- Duration: Acute use for respiratory symptoms; cycle for chronic support

## Safety Information

### Contraindications
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding (insufficient safety data)
- Photosensitivity disorders (coumarin content)
- Children under 12 years (potent medicine)
- Upcoming sun exposure (photosensitizing effects)

### Side Effects
- Photosensitivity with large doses or prolonged use
- Digestive upset with excessive consumption
- Possible allergic reactions in sensitive individuals
- Skin sensitivity with topical use

### Drug Interactions
- Photosensitizing medications
- Blood-thinning medications (coumarin effects)
- Liver-metabolized drugs
- Immune-suppressing medications

### Special Precautions
- Pregnancy/nursing: Avoid - insufficient safety data and potent effects
- Children's safety: Not recommended under 12 years without guidance
- Surgical considerations: Discontinue 2 weeks before surgery

## Cultivation & Harvesting

### Growing Conditions
- Soil requirements: Rich, moist, well-drained soil with high organic matter
- Light requirements: Partial shade; mimics mountain understory conditions
- Water needs: Consistent moisture; adapted to snowmelt cycles
- Climate zones: Very specific high-altitude requirements; difficult to cultivate at low elevations

### Harvesting
- Best time to harvest: Fall when plant energy returns to roots
- Sustainable harvesting practices: CRITICAL - wild populations severely threatened
- Post-harvest processing: Clean and dry roots carefully; traditional preparation methods

## Conservation Status
- Current conservation status: THREATENED - severe population declines due to overharvesting
- Threats to wild populations: Commercial harvesting pressure; slow growth; habitat disturbance
- Sustainable sourcing notes: AVOID wild harvesting; support cultivation efforts; use alternatives

## Cultural & Historical Context
- Traditional cultural significance: Sacred to many Native American tribes; spiritual medicine
- Historical timeline of use: Centuries of indigenous use; recent commercial exploitation
- Indigenous knowledge acknowledgment: Traditional knowledge from Navajo, Apache, and other southwestern tribes

## Modern Research
- Recent scientific studies: Antimicrobial and immune-stimulating properties documented
- Clinical trial results: Limited research due to conservation concerns and sourcing issues
- Ongoing research areas: Cultivation methods; sustainable sourcing; chemical analysis
