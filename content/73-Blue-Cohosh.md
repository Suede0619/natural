# Blue Cohosh (Caulophyllum thalictroides)

## Basic Information
- **Latin Name**: Caulophyllum thalictroides
- **Common Names**: Blue Cohosh, Papoose Root, Squaw Root, Blue Berry Root, Yellow Ginseng
- **Plant Family**: Berberidaceae (Barberry family)
- **Native Range**: Eastern North America, from southeastern Canada to northern Georgia
- **Habitat**: Rich, moist deciduous woodlands, often on slopes and ravines, in partial shade

## Plant Description

### Overall Appearance
Blue cohosh is a perennial woodland herb growing 1-3 feet tall with distinctive blue-purple stems and compound leaves. The plant has an elegant, upright growth habit.

### Roots
The rhizome is thick, knotted, and woody with numerous fibrous roots. Fresh rhizomes are yellowish-brown externally and whitish internally, becoming darker with age.

### Stem
Stems are smooth, erect, and often purplish or blue-tinted, especially when young. The stem is typically unbranched and hollow.

### Leaves
Large, compound leaves are divided into three leaflets, each further divided into 2-3 lobes. Leaves are blue-green with a waxy appearance and prominent veining.

### Flowers
Small, star-shaped flowers appear in terminal clusters in early spring before leaves fully develop. Flowers are yellow-green to purple-brown with 6 petals.

### Fruits/Seeds
Distinctive bright blue, berry-like seeds develop in late summer. The seeds are exposed when the thin pericarp ruptures, creating the plant's characteristic blue "berries."

## Medicinal Properties

### Parts Used
- Rhizome and roots (collected in autumn after seed set)

### Active Compounds
- Alkaloids (methylcystisine, anagyrine, baptifoline)
- Saponins (caulosaponin, caulophyllosaponin)
- Resin
- Gum
- Starch
- Potassium and calcium salts

### Traditional Uses
- Labor induction and facilitation of childbirth
- Menstrual regulation and relief of dysmenorrhea
- Treatment of rheumatism and arthritis
- Urinary tract infections
- Nervous system disorders
- Bronchitis and respiratory conditions

### Modern Applications
- Uterine tonic (though controversial due to safety concerns)
- Anti-inflammatory for joint conditions
- Antispasmodic for smooth muscle
- Research into alkaloid properties for various conditions

## Preparation Methods

### Traditional Preparations
- **Tea/Infusion**: 1 tsp dried root per cup water, steep 10-15 minutes
- **Decoction**: Simmer 1 oz root in 1 pint water for 20 minutes
- **Tincture**: 1:5 ratio in 50% alcohol, 10-30 drops 2-3 times daily
- **Poultice**: Powdered root mixed with water for external application
- **Syrup**: Combined with other herbs for respiratory conditions

### Dosage Guidelines
- Traditional dosages: Very small amounts, typically 1-2 grams of dried root
- Duration: Short-term use only, typically days to weeks

## Safety Information

### Contraindications
- Pregnancy (except under professional supervision for labor)
- Breastfeeding
- Children and adolescents
- Heart conditions
- Hypertension

### Side Effects
- Gastric irritation
- Nausea and vomiting
- Chest pain
- Hypertension

## Cultivation & Harvesting

### Growing Conditions
- Soil: Rich, well-drained, slightly acidic woodland soil
- Light: Partial to full shade
- Water: Consistent moisture but not waterlogged
- Climate zones: USDA zones 3-8

### Harvesting
- Best time: Late autumn after seeds have formed
- Sustainable practices: Harvest only older plants, leave younger ones to mature
- Post-harvest: Clean and dry rhizomes thoroughly before storage

## Conservation Status
- Currently stable but declining in some regions due to overharvesting
- Habitat loss from deforestation poses ongoing threats
- Sustainable cultivation and wild-crafting practices essential

## Cultural & Historical Context
- Used extensively by Native American tribes, particularly Cherokee and Ojibwe
- Name "papoose root" reflects traditional use in childbirth
- Introduced to European settlers as a women's medicine
- Listed in official pharmacopoeias until mid-20th century

## Modern Research
- Studies on alkaloid content and safety profile
- Research into anti-inflammatory properties
- Investigation of potential cardiovascular effects
- Ongoing evaluation of traditional uses versus safety concerns

## Related Species
- Black Cohosh (Actaea racemosa) - different family, similar traditional uses
- White Cohosh (Actaea pachypoda) - related but different medicinal properties
- Other Caulophyllum species in Asia with similar alkaloid profiles
