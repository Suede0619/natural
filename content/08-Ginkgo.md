- Tinnitus and vertigo treatment
- Intermittent claudication (poor leg circulation)
- Age-related macular degeneration
- Anxiety and depression support
- Antioxidant and neuroprotective effects

## Preparation Methods

### Traditional Preparations
- **Standardized extract**: EGb 761 and similar standardized preparations
- **Tea/Infusion**: 1-2 teaspoons dried leaves, though less effective than extracts
- **Tincture**: 1:5 ratio in 60% alcohol, 1-3 ml three times daily
- **Capsules**: Standardized extract in capsule form
- **Seeds**: Cooked seeds in Traditional Chinese Medicine

### Dosage Guidelines
- Traditional dosages: 120-240mg standardized extract daily, divided into 2-3 doses
- Duration: Effects may take 4-6 weeks to manifest; safe for long-term use

## Safety Information

- Bleeding disorders or before surgery
- Known allergy to ginkgo
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding (insufficient safety data)
- Epilepsy (may lower seizure threshold)

### Side Effects
- Mild digestive upset, headache, dizziness
- Increased bleeding risk
- Skin allergic reactions (especially from fresh leaves)
- Potential interactions with blood-thinning medications

### Drug Interactions
- Blood-thinning medications (warfarin, aspirin)
- Anticonvulsant medications
- Diabetes medications (may affect blood sugar)

### Growing Conditions
- Soil requirements: Adaptable to various soils; prefers well-drained, deep soil
- Light requirements: Full sun to partial shade
- Water needs: Moderate water; drought tolerant once established
- Climate zones: USDA zones 4-8; very adaptable and pollution tolerant

### Harvesting
- Best time to harvest: Leaves in late summer before they begin to yellow
- Sustainable harvesting practices: Harvest from cultivated trees only
- Post-harvest processing: Dry quickly and process into standardized extracts

## Conservation Status
- Current conservation status: Extinct in wild, widely cultivated
- Threats to wild populations: No longer exists in wild
- Sustainable sourcing notes: Cultivation only; abundant in parks and landscapes

## Cultural & Historical Context
- Traditional cultural significance: Sacred tree in Chinese and Japanese cultures
- Historical timeline of use: Seeds used in TCM for over 1,000 years; leaves used medicinally since 1960s
- Indigenous knowledge acknowledgment: Traditional Chinese medical knowledge

## Modern Research
- Recent scientific studies: Extensive research on cognitive and circulatory effects
- Clinical trial results: Mixed results for dementia; positive for circulation and tinnitus
- Ongoing research areas: Alzheimer's disease, stroke recovery, eye health

## Related Species
- Similar or related medicinal plants: No closely related species (living fossil)
- Potential substitutes or adulterants: No true substitutes; quality of extracts varies significantly
