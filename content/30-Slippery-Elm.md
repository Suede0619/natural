# Slippery Elm (Ulmus rubra)

## Basic Information
- **Latin Name**: Ulmus rubra (formerly Ulmus fulva)
- **Common Names**: Slippery Elm, Red Elm, Gray Elm, Soft Elm, Sweet Elm, Indian Elm, Moose Elm
- **Plant Family**: Ulmaceae (Elm family)
- **Native Range**: Eastern and central North America
- **Habitat**: Rich, moist woodlands, stream banks, and bottomlands; prefers well-drained, fertile soils at elevations up to 2,000 feet

## Plant Description

### Overall Appearance
Medium to large deciduous tree growing 40-60 feet tall with a broad, open crown and distinctive reddish-brown, mucilaginous inner bark.

### Roots
Deep taproot with extensive lateral root system; roots are fibrous and help prevent soil erosion along waterways.

### Stem
Straight trunk with dark brown, furrowed outer bark and distinctive reddish, mucilaginous inner bark that gives the tree its common name.

### Leaves
Alternate, simple, oval leaves 4-8 inches long with doubly serrated margins; leaves are dark green, rough-textured above, and softer beneath.

### Flowers
Small, inconspicuous, reddish-brown flowers that appear in dense clusters before the leaves emerge in early spring; flowers lack petals.

### Fruits/Seeds
Round, flat, winged fruits (samaras) about 1/2 inch across with a papery wing surrounding a central seed; fruits mature in late spring.

## Medicinal Properties

### Parts Used
- Inner bark (primary medicinal part)
- Occasionally outer bark preparations

### Active Compounds
- Mucilages (galactose, rhamnose, galacturonic acid)
- Tannins (condensed and hydrolyzable)
- Calcium oxalate and other minerals
- Starch and proteins
- Phenolic compounds
- Polyuronides and polysaccharides

### Traditional Uses
- Digestive disorders (diarrhea, dysentery, stomach ulcers)
- Respiratory conditions (sore throat, coughs, bronchitis)
- Skin conditions (wounds, burns, boils, inflammation)
- Urinary tract problems and kidney disorders
- Nutritional support during illness and convalescence
- Poultices for fractures and dislocations
- Eye inflammation and irritation

### Modern Applications
- Gastrointestinal tract soothing and protection
- Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) management
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) relief
- Inflammatory bowel conditions support
- Throat and mouth inflammation treatment
- Skin healing and wound care
- Nutritional supplement during illness

## Preparation Methods

### Traditional Preparations
- **Gruel**: 1 tablespoon powdered bark mixed with water to form thick paste, then thinned
- **Tea/Infusion**: 1-2 teaspoons powdered bark per cup boiling water, steep 15 minutes
- **Decoction**: 1 tablespoon bark per cup water, simmer 20 minutes
- **Poultice**: Powdered bark mixed with water to form paste for external application
- **Lozenges**: Traditional preparation with honey for throat conditions

### Dosage Guidelines
- Traditional dosages: 4-16 grams powdered bark daily as gruel or in divided doses
- Duration: Can be used as needed for acute conditions; safe for extended use

## Safety Information

### Contraindications
- No known absolute contraindications
- Pregnancy (traditional contraindication, though likely safe)
- May delay absorption of medications

### Side Effects
- Generally extremely safe with minimal side effects
- Rare allergic reactions in sensitive individuals
- Possible constipation with very large amounts
- May slow absorption of other medications taken simultaneously

### Drug Interactions
- May delay absorption of medications taken at the same time
- No known serious drug interactions
- Blood sugar medications (theoretical interaction due to fiber content)

### Special Precautions
- Pregnancy/nursing: Traditional contraindication, though modern evidence suggests safety
- Medication timing: Take other medications 1 hour before or 2 hours after slippery elm
- Quality sourcing: Ensure sustainably harvested bark

## Cultivation & Harvesting

### Growing Conditions
- Soil requirements: Rich, moist, well-drained soil; pH 6.0-8.0
- Light requirements: Full sun to partial shade
- Water needs: Moderate to high moisture; drought sensitive when young
- Climate zones: USDA zones 3-9

### Harvesting
- Best time to harvest: Inner bark in spring when sap is flowing
- Sustainable harvesting practices: Harvest bark strips without ring-barking trees; allow healing between harvests
- Post-harvest processing: Remove outer bark; dry inner bark quickly; grind to powder

## Conservation Status
- Current conservation status: Threatened by Dutch elm disease and habitat loss
- Threats to wild populations: Disease, over-harvesting, urbanization, climate change
- Sustainable sourcing notes: Wild harvest should be minimal; cultivation efforts needed

## Cultural & Historical Context
- Traditional cultural significance: Important medicine and emergency food for Native American tribes
- Historical timeline of use: Used by Native Americans for centuries; adopted by European settlers
- Indigenous knowledge acknowledgment: Traditional knowledge from numerous Native American tribes

## Modern Research
- Recent scientific studies: Limited modern research on traditional uses
- Clinical trial results: Minimal clinical trials; strong traditional evidence
- Ongoing research areas: Mucilage mechanisms, digestive protection, wound healing

## Related Species
- Similar or related medicinal plants: Ulmus americana (American Elm), other Ulmus species
- Potential substitutes or adulterants: Other mucilaginous barks, but none with identical properties
