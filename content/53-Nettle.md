## Medicinal Properties

### Parts Used
- Leaves (primary medicinal use - must be dried or cooked)
- Roots (for prostate health)
- Seeds (nutritional and reproductive health)
- Young shoots (culinary and medicinal)

### Active Compounds
- Histamine (anti-inflammatory when processed)
- Formic acid (stinging compound, anti-inflammatory when dried)
- Chlorophyll (wound healing, detoxification)
- Lectins (immune system modulation)
- Lignans (hormone balancing)
- Minerals (iron, calcium, potassium, silica)

### Traditional Uses
- Arthritis and joint pain
- Allergies and hay fever
- Urinary tract health and prostate issues
- Anemia and iron deficiency
- Hair loss and scalp health
- Eczema and skin conditions

### Modern Applications
- Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)
- Seasonal allergies and rhinitis
- Osteoarthritis pain and inflammation
- Iron deficiency anemia
- Blood sugar regulation
- Kidney and urinary support

## Preparation Methods

### Traditional Preparations
- **Tea/Infusion**: 2-3 teaspoons dried leaves per cup boiling water; steep 10-15 minutes
- **Decoction**: Roots simmered 20 minutes for prostate support
- **Tincture**: 1:3 ratio with 50% alcohol; macerate dried leaves 4 weeks
- **Poultice**: Dried leaves reconstituted for topical anti-inflammatory use
- **Oil Infusion**: Dried leaves in carrier oil for hair and scalp treatment

### Dosage Guidelines
- Traditional dosages: 2-4 grams dried leaves daily; 300-600mg root extract daily
- Duration: Safe for long-term use

## Safety Information

### Contraindications
- Fresh plant contact (causes stinging)
- Pregnancy (may stimulate uterine contractions)
- Edema due to heart or kidney problems
- Low blood pressure

### Side Effects
- Generally well-tolerated when properly prepared
- Mild digestive upset initially
- Skin irritation with fresh plant contact
- Possible diuretic effects

### Drug Interactions
- Blood pressure medications (may enhance effects)

- Soil requirements: Rich, moist, nitrogen-rich soil with pH 6.0-7.5
- Light requirements: Partial shade to full sun
- Water needs: Consistent moisture; tolerates wet conditions
- Climate zones: Hardy in zones 3-9; may be aggressive spreader

### Harvesting
- Best time to harvest: Young leaves before flowering; roots in autumn
- Sustainable harvesting practices: Wear gloves; cut leaving roots intact
- Post-harvest processing: Dry immediately to eliminate stinging properties

## Conservation Status
- Current conservation status: Not threatened; often considered invasive
- Threats to wild populations: None; extremely robust and widespread
- Sustainable sourcing notes: Easy to cultivate; excellent for permaculture systems

## Cultural & Historical Context
- Traditional cultural significance: Used for fiber production; traditional European "urtication" therapy
- Historical timeline of use: Thousands of years across multiple cultures; Roman soldiers used for warmth
- Indigenous knowledge acknowledgment: Traditional uses in European, Asian, and Native American cultures

## Modern Research
- Recent scientific studies: BPH treatment and allergy relief well-documented
- Clinical trial results: Significant improvement in prostate symptoms and seasonal allergies
- Ongoing research areas: Diabetes management; cancer prevention; autoimmune conditions
