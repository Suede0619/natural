- **Plant Family**: Ericaceae (Heath family)
- **Native Range**: Eastern North America, from Newfoundland to Georgia and west to Manitoba and Alabama
- **Habitat**: Acidic soils in coniferous and mixed forests, often under evergreens and rhododendrons

## Plant Description

### Overall Appearance
Wintergreen is a low-growing evergreen subshrub, typically 3-6 inches tall, forming colonies through underground rhizomes.

### Roots
Shallow, spreading rhizome system with fine roots that form extensive mats in suitable acidic soil conditions.

### Stem
Short, creeping stems are woody at the base with upright branches bearing leaves clustered toward the tips.

### Leaves
Alternate, oval evergreen leaves are 1-2 inches long with serrated margins. Leaves are dark green, glossy, and aromatic when crushed.

### Flowers
Small, white, bell-shaped flowers hang singly from leaf axils in summer. Flowers are waxy and about 1/4 inch long.

### Fruits/Seeds
Bright red berries about 1/4 inch diameter persist through winter. Berries are edible with a strong wintergreen flavor.

## Medicinal Properties

### Parts Used
- Leaves (primary medicinal part)
- Berries (edible, mild medicinal value)

### Active Compounds
- Methyl salicylate (up to 98% of essential oil)
- Tannins
- Flavonoids (quercetin, rutin)
- Arbutin and other phenolic glycosides
- Gaultherin (converts to methyl salicylate)
- Vitamin C

### Traditional Uses
- Pain relief and anti-inflammatory conditions
- Rheumatism and arthritis
- Muscle and joint pain
- Headaches and neuralgia
- Respiratory conditions
- Digestive ailments

### Modern Applications
- Topical pain relief for muscles and joints
- Natural source of methyl salicylate
- Flavoring agent for foods and medicines
- Anti-inflammatory for external use
- Aromatherapy and liniments

## Preparation Methods

### Traditional Preparations
- **Tea/Infusion**: 1 tsp dried leaves per cup water, steep 10-15 minutes
- **Oil infusion**: Leaves steeped in carrier oil for topical use
- **Liniment**: Alcohol-based preparation for external application
- **Poultice**: Fresh crushed leaves applied directly to skin
- **Steam inhalation**: For respiratory conditions

### Dosage Guidelines
- Traditional dosages: 1-2 cups tea daily
- External use: Apply oil or liniment as needed for pain relief

## Safety Information

### Contraindications
- Salicylate allergy or aspirin sensitivity
- Children under 16 (due to salicylate content and Reye's syndrome risk)
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding (high salicylate content)
- Blood clotting disorders

### Side Effects
- Skin irritation with prolonged topical use
- Possible systemic salicylate effects with excessive use
- Gastric upset if consumed in large quantities
- Potential for salicylate toxicity

### Drug Interactions
- May enhance effects of blood-thinning medications
- Possible interactions with diabetes medications
- May increase effects of other salicylate-containing drugs
- Caution with kidney medications

### Special Precautions
- Pregnancy/nursing: Avoid due to high salicylate content
- Children's safety: Contraindicated in children under 16
- Topical use: Use sparingly and avoid broken skin

## Cultivation & Harvesting

### Growing Conditions
- Soil: Acidic, well-drained, organic-rich soil (pH 4.5-6.0)
- Light: Partial to full shade
- Water: Consistent moisture but not waterlogged
- Climate zones: USDA zones 3-7

### Harvesting
- Best time: Late summer to fall when essential oil content is highest
- Sustainable practices: Harvest only older leaves, maintain colony structure
- Post-harvest: Dry carefully to preserve volatile oils

## Conservation Status
- Generally stable throughout most of native range
- Some local declines due to habitat loss and acid rain
- Sensitive to soil pH changes from pollution

## Cultural & Historical Context
- Used extensively by Native American tribes for pain relief
- Important food flavoring and medicine for early American settlers
- Traditional source of "teaberry" flavoring for gum and candy
- Featured in 19th-century patent medicines

## Modern Research
- Studies on anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties
- Research into topical absorption and safety
- Investigation of antioxidant properties
- Comparison with synthetic methyl salicylate preparations

- Betula lenta (Sweet Birch) - different family, similar methyl salicylate content
- Filipendula ulmaria (Meadowsweet) - different family, related salicylates
- Other Gaultheria species worldwide with varying oil content
