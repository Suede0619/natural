## Basic Information
- **Latin Name**: Hydrastis canadensis
- **Common Names**: Goldenseal, Yellow root, Orange root, Indian turmeric, Eye balm
- **Plant Family**: Ranunculaceae (Buttercup family)
- **Native Range**: Northeastern United States and southeastern Canada
- **Habitat**: Rich, moist deciduous forests; shaded understory; well-drained humus soils

## Plant Description

### Overall Appearance
Perennial herb growing 6-12 inches tall with distinctive palmate leaves and bright yellow rhizome system.

### Roots
Thick, yellow-orange rhizome (underground stem) with bright yellow interior; bitter taste; fibrous roots extend from rhizome.

### Stem
Simple, erect stem; hairy texture; usually bearing two leaves; dies back completely in winter.

### Leaves
Two palmate leaves with 5-7 deeply lobed segments; serrated margins; wrinkled texture; alternate arrangement.

### Flowers
Single, small, inconspicuous greenish-white flower; no petals, only sepals; appears in spring before leaves fully develop.

### Fruits/Seeds
Red, raspberry-like aggregate fruit containing 10-30 black seeds; matures in summer; birds disperse seeds.

## Medicinal Properties

### Parts Used
- Rhizome (underground stem - primary medicinal use)
- Roots (secondary use)
- Dried powder from rhizome
- Fresh rhizome (rarely used due to sustainability concerns)

### Active Compounds
- Berberine (antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, blood sugar regulation)
- Hydrastine (vasoconstrictor, antimicrobial)
- Canadine (antimicrobial, muscle relaxant)
- Isoquinoline alkaloids (various physiological effects)
- Chlorogenic acid (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory)
- Meconin (mild sedative effects)

### Traditional Uses
- Digestive disorders and infections
- Respiratory infections and sinusitis
- Eye infections and conjunctivitis
- Wound healing and skin infections
- Urinary tract infections
- Digestive inflammation and ulcers

### Modern Applications
- Antimicrobial and antibacterial effects
- Digestive health and gastric protection
- Upper respiratory tract infections
- Blood sugar regulation support
- Anti-inflammatory and immune support
- Topical antimicrobial applications

## Preparation Methods

### Traditional Preparations
- **Tea/Infusion**: 1/2 teaspoon dried root per cup; steep 15-20 minutes
- **Decoction**: Small amounts simmered 10-15 minutes for stronger effects
- **Tincture**: 1:5 ratio with 60% alcohol; macerate dried root 4-6 weeks
- **Poultice**: Ground root mixed with water for topical antimicrobial use
- **Eye wash**: Very dilute preparation for conjunctivitis (professional guidance recommended)

### Dosage Guidelines
- Traditional dosages: 0.5-2 grams dried root daily; use sparingly due to sustainability
- Duration: Short-term use only; not for long-term daily consumption

## Safety Information

### Contraindications
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding (uterine stimulant)
- High blood pressure (may increase)
- Heart conditions (cardiovascular effects)
- Liver disease (processing burden)

### Side Effects
- Digestive upset and nausea with large doses
- Possible blood pressure elevation
- Skin and mucous membrane irritation
- Allergic reactions in sensitive individuals

### Drug Interactions
- Blood pressure medications
- Blood-thinning medications
- Diabetes medications (may enhance effects)
- Liver-metabolized drugs

### Special Precautions
- Pregnancy/nursing: AVOID - can stimulate uterine contractions
- Children's safety: Use only under professional guidance
- Surgical considerations: Discontinue 2 weeks before surgery

## Cultivation & Harvesting

### Growing Conditions
- Soil requirements: Rich, moist, well-drained forest soil with high organic matter
- Light requirements: Deep to partial shade (80-90% shade)
- Water needs: Consistent moisture; intolerant of drought
- Climate zones: Hardy in zones 3-8; requires cold winter dormancy

### Harvesting
- Best time to harvest: Fall after 5-7 years of growth (sustainability critical)
- Sustainable harvesting practices: CRITICALLY IMPORTANT - plant is overharvested
- Post-harvest processing: Clean and dry rhizomes carefully; replant annually

## Conservation Status
- Current conservation status: Vulnerable to critically endangered in many states
- Threats to wild populations: Severe overharvesting and habitat destruction
- Sustainable sourcing notes: ONLY use cultivated sources; avoid wild-harvested

## Cultural & Historical Context
- Traditional cultural significance: Sacred to many Native American tribes; "Cherokee name plant"
- Historical timeline of use: Centuries of indigenous use; 19th-century commercial exploitation
- Indigenous knowledge acknowledgment: Traditional Cherokee, Iroquois, and other tribal knowledge

## Modern Research
- Recent scientific studies: Antimicrobial and berberine effects extensively documented
- Clinical trial results: Blood sugar regulation and antimicrobial benefits confirmed
- Ongoing research areas: Antibiotic resistance; metabolic health; sustainable cultivation

## Related Species
- Oregon grape (Mahonia aquifolium) - contains berberine but different family
- Barberry (Berberis vulgaris) - similar alkaloid profile
- Yellow dock (Rumex crispus) - different compounds despite similar common name
