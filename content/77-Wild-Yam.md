## Plant Description

### Overall Appearance
Wild yam is a perennial climbing vine that can reach 10-15 feet in length, twining counterclockwise around supports.

### Roots
The rhizome is the most medicinally valuable part - thick, knotty, and irregularly branched with a hard, woody texture when dried.

### Stem
Slender, smooth, green to reddish stems that twine counterclockwise. Stems die back to the ground each winter.

### Leaves
Heart-shaped leaves are arranged alternately on the stem, with prominent parallel veins running from base to tip. Leaves are 2-6 inches long.

### Flowers
Small, greenish-white flowers appear in drooping clusters from leaf axils in summer. Plants are dioecious (separate male and female plants).

### Fruits/Seeds
Three-winged capsules develop on female plants, containing flat, winged seeds that disperse by wind.
