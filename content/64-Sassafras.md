# Sassafras (Sassafras albidum)

## Basic Information
- **Latin Name**: Sassafras albidum
- **Common Names**: Sassafras, White sassafras, Red sassafras, Silky sassafras
- **Plant Family**: Lauraceae (Laurel family)
- **Native Range**: Eastern North America from Maine to Florida
- **Habitat**: Deciduous forests; forest edges; well-drained acidic soils; full sun to partial shade

## Plant Description

### Overall Appearance
Deciduous tree or large shrub reaching 30-60 feet tall with distinctive three-lobed leaves and aromatic bark.

### Roots
Deep taproot with lateral spreading roots; forms colonies through root suckers; highly aromatic.

### Stem
Bark furrowed and reddish-brown on mature trees; younger bark smooth and green; all parts aromatic.

### Leaves
Distinctive three-lobed leaves (mitten-shaped); some leaves entire, others 2-3 lobed; bright green turning yellow-orange in fall.

### Flowers
Small, yellow-green flowers in clusters; dioecious (male and female flowers on separate trees); appear before leaves.

### Fruits/Seeds
Dark blue berries on red stalks (female trees only); single seed; important food for birds.

## Medicinal Properties

### Parts Used
- Root bark (historical use - now restricted)
- Leaves (filé powder for culinary use)
- Twigs and branches (sassafras tea)
- Essential oil (commercial extraction)

### Active Compounds
- Safrole (80-90% of root oil; banned due to carcinogenicity)
- Eugenol (anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial)
- Camphor (stimulating, antimicrobial)
- Asarone (psychoactive, potentially toxic)
- Mucilage in leaves (thickening agent, soothing)
- Tannins (astringent, anti-inflammatory)

### Traditional Uses
- Blood purification and "spring tonic"
- Rheumatism and arthritis
- Skin conditions and eczema
- Digestive disorders
- Fever reduction
- Respiratory ailments

### Modern Applications
- Historical interest only (root products banned)
- Culinary use of leaves (filé powder)
- Aromatic applications (safrole-free preparations)
- Research into safrole-free compounds
- Traditional flavoring (root beer - now synthetic)

## Preparation Methods

### Traditional Preparations
- **CAUTION**: Root preparations banned due to safrole content
- **Leaf tea**: Young leaves for mild, mucilaginous beverage
- **Twig tea**: Small twigs and bark for traditional "sassafras tea"
- **Filé powder**: Dried, ground leaves for culinary thickening
- **Historical tinctures**: Now prohibited due to safety concerns

### Dosage Guidelines
- Traditional dosages: ROOT PRODUCTS BANNED - leaves and twigs only
- Duration: Occasional culinary use of leaves only

## Safety Information

### Contraindications
- Root bark and essential oil (BANNED - carcinogenic safrole)
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding (safety concerns)
- Children (avoid root products entirely)
- Liver disease (safrole hepatotoxicity)

### Side Effects
- Liver damage with safrole-containing preparations
- Potential carcinogenic effects (root products)
- Digestive upset with excessive use
- Allergic reactions in sensitive individuals

### Drug Interactions
- Liver-metabolized medications (if using safrole-containing products)
- Blood-thinning medications (theoretical)
- Generally avoid medicinal use due to restrictions

### Special Precautions
- Pregnancy/nursing: Avoid all but occasional culinary leaf use
- Children's safety: Avoid root products; leaves generally safe
- Surgical considerations: No current medicinal use recommended

## Cultivation & Harvesting

### Growing Conditions
- Soil requirements: Well-drained, acidic soil; tolerates poor soils
- Light requirements: Full sun to partial shade
- Water needs: Moderate moisture; drought tolerant once established
- Climate zones: Hardy in zones 4-9; native plant adaptability

### Harvesting
- Best time to harvest: Leaves in spring and summer; avoid root harvesting
- Sustainable harvesting practices: Harvest leaves only; support tree health
- Post-harvest processing: Dry leaves for filé powder; avoid root processing

## Conservation Status
- Current conservation status: Common in native range; some local declines
- Threats to wild populations: Habitat loss and overharvesting historically
- Sustainable sourcing notes: Harvest leaves only; support forest conservation

## Cultural & Historical Context
- Traditional cultural significance: Important to Native American tribes; early European colonial use
- Historical timeline of use: Centuries of indigenous use; major commercial crop until safrole ban
- Indigenous knowledge acknowledgment: Traditional Choctaw and other tribal knowledge

## Modern Research
- Recent scientific studies: Safrole carcinogenicity confirmed; safrole-free compounds studied
- Clinical trial results: No current trials due to safety restrictions
- Ongoing research areas: Safrole-free extracts; leaf compounds; historical pharmacology

- California sassafras (Sassafras californicum) - similar compounds, different region
- Spice bush (Lindera benzoin) - same family, different alkaloid profile
- Camphor tree (Cinnamomum camphora) - related aromatic tree
