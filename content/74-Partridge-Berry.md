## Plant Description

### Overall Appearance
Partridge berry is a low-growing, evergreen perennial vine that forms dense mats along the forest floor. The trailing stems can extend 6-12 inches long.

### Roots
Fibrous root system with adventitious roots developing at nodes along the creeping stems, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.

### Stem
Slender, trailing stems are smooth, reddish-brown, and woody at the base. Stems root at nodes where they touch the ground.

### Leaves
Small, opposite, rounded to oval leaves are 1/4 to 1/2 inch long. Leaves are dark green, glossy, evergreen with prominent white veining and smooth margins.

### Flowers
Small, tubular, white to pinkish flowers appear in pairs at stem tips in late spring to early summer. Each flower has 4 petals and a sweet fragrance.

### Fruits/Seeds
Bright red berries, about 1/4 inch diameter, persist through winter. Each berry is actually formed from two fused flowers, hence "two-eyed berry."
