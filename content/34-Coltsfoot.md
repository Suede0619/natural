# Coltsfoot (Tussilago farfara)

## Basic Information
- **Latin Name**: Tussilago farfara
- **Common Names**: Coltsfoot, Coughwort, Horsehoof, Foalfoot, Butterbur, Huflattich (German), Tussilage (French)
- **Plant Family**: Asteraceae (Sunflower family)
- **Native Range**: Europe, western and northern Asia
- **Habitat**: Disturbed soils, roadsides, stream banks, and clay soils; thrives in moist, alkaline conditions at elevations up to 8,000 feet

## Plant Description

### Overall Appearance
Low perennial herb with distinctive flowering pattern: bright yellow flowers appear before leaves in early spring, followed by large, heart-shaped leaves.

### Roots
Extensive creeping rhizome system that spreads underground; rhizomes are white to pale brown and can form large colonies.

### Stem
Flowering stems are 4-12 inches tall, covered with purple-tinged scales and woolly hairs; no true stem for leaves (they emerge directly from rhizomes).

### Leaves
Large, heart-shaped to rounded leaves 4-8 inches across that appear after flowering; leaves are dark green above, white-woolly beneath with prominent veining.

### Flowers
Bright yellow, daisy-like flower heads that appear in early spring before leaves; flowers are 1/2 to 1 inch across on short, scaly stems.

### Fruits/Seeds
Small achenes with fluffy white pappus for wind dispersal; seeds are produced in late spring after flowering completes.

## Medicinal Properties

### Parts Used
- Leaves (primary medicinal part)
- Flowers (traditional respiratory use)
- Roots (occasional traditional use)

### Active Compounds
- Mucilages and polysaccharides
- Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (senkirkine, tussilagine) - potentially toxic
- Flavonoids (rutin, hyperoside, isoquercitrin)
- Tannins and saponins
- Triterpenes and sterols
- Inulin and essential oils

### Traditional Uses
- Respiratory conditions (coughs, bronchitis, asthma)
- Throat inflammation and laryngitis
- Lung congestion and phlegm
- Skin conditions (wounds, burns, ulcers)
- Inflammatory conditions and swelling
- Digestive complaints and gastritis
- Urinary tract disorders

### Modern Applications
- Respiratory tract soothing (with safety concerns)
- Anti-inflammatory effects for airways
- Wound healing and skin protection
- Cough suppression (traditional use being reevaluated)
- Topical applications for inflammation

## Preparation Methods

### Traditional Preparations
- **Tea/Infusion**: 1-2 teaspoons dried leaves per cup boiling water, steep 10 minutes
- **Decoction**: 1 tablespoon leaves per cup water, simmer 15 minutes
- **Poultice**: Fresh leaves applied directly to wounds or inflammation
- **Syrup**: Traditional preparation with honey for coughs
- **Smoking Blend**: Dried leaves traditionally smoked for respiratory relief

### Dosage Guidelines
- Traditional dosages: 2-4 grams dried leaves daily (now limited due to safety concerns)
- Duration: Limited use recommended due to pyrrolizidine alkaloid content

## Safety Information

### Contraindications
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding (pyrrolizidine alkaloids)
- Liver disease or dysfunction
- Children under 18 years (safety concerns)
- Long-term use (hepatotoxicity risk)

### Side Effects
- Potential liver toxicity with prolonged use
- Possible carcinogenic effects (animal studies)
- Allergic reactions in sensitive individuals
- Gastrointestinal upset with large doses

### Drug Interactions
- Hepatotoxic medications (increased liver risk)
- Liver-metabolized drugs (potential interference)

### Special Precautions
- Pregnancy/nursing: Contraindicated due to pyrrolizidine alkaloids
- Liver monitoring: Essential with any use
- Duration limits: Avoid continuous or long-term use
- Modern safety: Many countries restrict or ban internal use

## Cultivation & Harvesting

### Growing Conditions
- Soil requirements: Moist, clay or alkaline soil; pH 7.0-8.5
- Light requirements: Full sun to partial shade
- Water needs: Consistent moisture; thrives in wet conditions
- Climate zones: USDA zones 3-8

### Harvesting
- Best time to harvest: Leaves in late spring after full expansion; flowers in early spring
- Sustainable harvesting practices: Harvest leaves selectively; extensive rhizome system ensures regeneration
- Post-harvest processing: Dry quickly in shade; store in dry conditions

## Conservation Status
- Current conservation status: Stable and common in suitable habitats
- Threats to wild populations: Generally not threatened; adaptable species
- Sustainable sourcing notes: Abundant where established; easy to cultivate

## Cultural & Historical Context
- Traditional cultural significance: Ancient European remedy; name "tussilago" means "cough dispeller"
- Historical timeline of use: Used for over 2,500 years; mentioned by Hippocrates and Dioscorides
- Indigenous knowledge acknowledgment: Traditional European herbal knowledge

## Modern Research
- Recent scientific studies: Safety research on pyrrolizidine alkaloids has limited use
- Clinical trial results: Traditional benefits outweighed by safety concerns
- Ongoing research areas: Safer preparations, topical applications, alkaloid-free extracts

## Related Species
- Similar or related medicinal plants: Petasites hybridus (Butterbur), other Tussilago species
- Potential substitutes or adulterants: Petasites species, other large-leaved Asteraceae
