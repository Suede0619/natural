- **Common Names**: Oak, White oak, Red oak, English oak, Acorn tree
- **Plant Family**: Fagaceae (Beech family)
- **Native Range**: Northern Hemisphere temperate regions
- **Habitat**: Various forest types; well-drained to moist soils; full sun to partial shade

## Plant Description

### Overall Appearance
Deciduous trees reaching 50-100+ feet tall with broad crowns and distinctive lobed leaves; long-lived species.

### Roots
Deep taproot with extensive lateral root system; forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.

### Stem
Massive trunk with distinctive furrowed bark; extremely durable and long-lived wood.

### Leaves
Lobed leaves varying by species; white oak has rounded lobes, red oak has pointed lobes; turn brown to red in fall.

### Flowers
Inconspicuous wind-pollinated flowers; male catkins and female flowers appear in spring.

### Fruits/Seeds
Acorns with distinctive caps; important food source for wildlife; tannin content varies by species.

## Medicinal Properties

### Parts Used
- Bark (primary medicinal use - inner bark preferred)
- Leaves (secondary use)
- Acorns (food and traditional medicine)
- Galls (oak apples - high tannin content)

### Active Compounds
- Tannins (15-20% in bark; astringent, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial)
- Quercitol (sugar alcohol; mild laxative)
- Quercetin (flavonoid; antioxidant, anti-inflammatory)
- Gallic acid (phenolic; antimicrobial, astringent)
- Ellagic acid (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory)
- Catechins (antioxidant, cardiovascular protection)

### Traditional Uses
- Diarrhea and digestive disorders
- Hemorrhoids and varicose veins
- Wounds and skin conditions
- Sore throat and mouth inflammation
- Excessive bleeding and discharge
- Eczema and dermatitis

### Modern Applications
- Astringent for digestive issues
- Topical wound healing and skin care
- Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects
- Hemorrhoid treatment support
- Natural tanning and leather production
- Traditional oral care applications

## Preparation Methods

### Traditional Preparations
- **Tea/Infusion**: 1-2 teaspoons dried bark per cup; steep 15-20 minutes
- **Decoction**: Bark simmered 20-30 minutes for stronger astringent effects
- **Tincture**: 1:5 ratio with 40% alcohol; macerate dried bark 4-6 weeks
- **Poultice**: Ground bark mixed with water for topical applications
- **Gargle**: Cooled decoction for sore throat and oral inflammation

### Dosage Guidelines
- Traditional dosages: 1-3 grams dried bark daily; 2-3 cups tea daily
- Duration: Short to medium-term use for acute conditions

## Safety Information

### Contraindications
- Large internal doses (excessive tannin intake)
- Kidney disease (tannin processing burden)
- Iron deficiency (tannins reduce iron absorption)
- Damaged intestinal lining

### Side Effects
- Generally well-tolerated in appropriate doses
- Possible digestive upset with large doses
- Constipation with excessive tannin intake
- Nausea in sensitive individuals

### Drug Interactions
- Iron supplements (reduced absorption)
- Alkaline medications (tannins may interfere)
- Generally minimal interactions in normal doses

### Special Precautions
- Pregnancy/nursing: Generally safe in food amounts and moderate medicinal use
- Children's safety: Safe in appropriate doses
- Surgical considerations: No significant contraindications

## Cultivation & Harvesting

### Growing Conditions
- Soil requirements: Well-drained, deep soil; tolerates various pH levels
- Light requirements: Full sun for optimal growth
- Water needs: Moderate moisture; drought tolerant once established
- Climate zones: Varies by species; generally hardy in zones 3-9

### Harvesting
- Best time to harvest: Bark in spring when sap is rising; leaves in summer
- Sustainable harvesting practices: Never girdle tree; take small sections only
- Post-harvest processing: Dry bark strips quickly; avoid excessive heat

## Conservation Status
- Current conservation status: Most species stable; some threatened by disease
- Threats to wild populations: Oak wilt, sudden oak death, habitat fragmentation
- Sustainable sourcing notes: Support oak forest conservation; sustainable harvesting

## Cultural & Historical Context
- Traditional cultural significance: Sacred to many cultures; symbol of strength and longevity
- Historical timeline of use: Millennia of use across cultures; important for food and medicine
- Indigenous knowledge acknowledgment: Traditional knowledge from multiple cultures worldwide

## Modern Research
- Recent scientific studies: Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties confirmed
- Clinical trial results: Effective for diarrhea and topical wound healing
- Ongoing research areas: Cardiovascular protection; cancer prevention; antimicrobial applications
